The induction mechanisms of T. reesei cellulases have been described recently, but the regulation of the genes involved in their transcription has not been studied thoroughly. Here we report the regulation of expression of the two activator genes xyr1 and ace2, and the corepressor gene ace1, during the induction of cellulase biosynthesis by the inducer lactose in T. reesei QM 9414, a strain producing low levels of cellulase (low producer). We show that all three genes are induced by lactose. xyr1 was also induced by d-galactose, but this induction was independent of d-galactose metabolism. Moreover, ace1 was carbon catabolite repressed, whereas full induction of xyr1 and ace2 in fact required CRE1. Significant differences in these regulatory patterns were observed in the high-producer strain RUT C30 and the hyperproducer strain T. reesei CL847. These observations suggest that a strongly elevated basal transcription level of xyr1 and reduced upregulation of ace1 by lactose may have been important for generating the hyperproducer strain and that thus, these genes are major control elements of cellulase production.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-02879336,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.bibs']"

Eoulsan is a versatile open-source workflow engine meeting the needs of core facilities, by automating the analysis of a large number of samples. Its core design separates the description of the workflow from the actual commands to be run. This originality simplifies its usage as the user does not need to handle code, while ensuring reproducibility. Eoulsan was initially developed for bulk RNA-seq data, but the transcriptomics applications have recently widened with the advent of long-read sequencing and single-cell technologies, calling for the development of new workflows. Result We present Eoulsan 2, a major update that (i) enhances the workflow manager itself, (ii) facilitates the development of new modules, and (iii) expands its applications to long reads RNA-seq (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and scRNA-seq (Smart-seq2 and 10x Genomics). The workflow manager has been rewritten, with support for execution on a larger choice of computational infrastructure (workstations, Hadoop clusters, and various job schedulers for cluster usage). Eoulsan now facilitates the development of new modules, by reusing wrappers developed for the Galaxy platform, with support for container images (Docker or Singularity) packaging tools to execute. Finally, Eoulsan natively integrates novel modules for bulk RNA-seq, as well as others specifically designed for processing long read RNA-seq and scRNA-seq. Eoulsan 2 is distributed with ready-to-use workflows and companion tutorials. Availability and implementation Eoulsan is implemented in Java, supported on Linux systems and distributed under the LGPL and CeCILL-C licenses at: http://outils.genomique.biologie.ens.fr/eoulsan/ .

This led to the definition of a set of 10 genes that show specific expression in BC cells and/or in their derivatives along the nerve roots. Analysis of the expression of these genes during mouse development revealed novel features, of those most important are: (i) dorsal and ventral nerve root BC cell derivatives express different sets of genes, suggesting that they have distinct properties; (ii) these cells undergo major modifications in their gene expression pattern between embryonic days 14.5 and 17.5, possibly linked to the SCpr-immature Schwann cell transition; (iii) nerve roots SC differ from more distal SC not only in their origins and locations, but also in their gene expression patterns.

The highly productive strains in use today were generated by classical mutagenesis. As byproducts of this procedure, mutants were generated that turned out to be unable to produce cellulases. In order to identify the mutations responsible for this inability, we sequenced the genome of one of these strains, QM9136, and compared it to that of its progenitor T. reesei QM6a. Results : In QM9136, we detected a surprisingly low number of mutagenic events in the promoter and coding regions of genes, i.e. only eight indels and six single nucleotide variants. One of these indels led to a frame-shift in the Zn2Cys6 transcription factor XYR1, the general regulator of cellulase and xylanase expression, and resulted in its C-terminal truncation by 140 amino acids. Retransformation of strain QM9136 with the wild-type xyr1 allele fully recovered the ability to produce cellulases, and is thus the reason for the cellulase-negative phenotype. Introduction of an engineered xyr1 allele containing the truncating point mutation into the moderate producer T. reesei QM9414 rendered this strain also cellulase-negative. The correspondingly truncated XYR1 protein was still able to enter the nucleus, but failed to be expressed over the basal constitutive level. Conclusion : The missing 140 C-terminal amino acids of XYR1 are therefore responsible for its previously observed auto-regulation which is essential for cellulases to be expressed. Our data present a working example of the use of genome sequencing leading to a functional explanation of the QM9136 cellulase-negative phenotype.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01149671,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp']"

Experimental data indicated that this decrease was a strong determinant of renal fibrogenesis, hence a focus for therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, whether persistently differentiated renal tubules, surviving in a pro-fibrotic environment, also suffer from a decrease in FAO, is currently unknown. Methods: To address this question, we isolated proximal tubules captured ex vivo on the basis of the expression of an intact brush border antigen (Prominin-1) in C57BL6/J mice subjected to a controlled, two-hit model of renal fibrosis (reversible ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) or sham surgery, followed by angiotensin 2 administration). A transcriptomic high throughput sequencing was performed on total mRNA from these cells, and on whole kidneys. Results: In contrast to mice subjected to sham surgery, mice with a history of AKI displayed histologically more renal fibrosis when exposed to angiotensin 2. High throughput RNA sequencing, principal component analysis and clustering showed marked consistency within experimental groups. As expected, FAO transcripts were decreased in whole fibrotic kidneys. Surprisingly, however, up- rather than down-regulation of metabolic pathways (oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, and PPAR signalling pathway) was a hallmark of the differentiated tubules captured from fibrotic kidneys. Immunofluorescence co-staining analysis confirmed that the expression of FAO enzymes was dependent of tubular trophicity.

The persistence of A(1)R/D(1)R heteromerization seems to be essential for the blockade of A(1)R agonist-induced A(1)R/D(1)R coclustering and for the desensitization of the D(1)R agonist-induced cAMP accumulation seen on combined pretreatment with D(1)R and A(1)R agonists, which indicates a potential role of A(1)R/D(1)R heteromers also in desensitization mechanisms and receptor trafficking.']",https://hal.science/hal-00122183,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.neu']"

As measured by cAMP accumulation in transfected COS-7 cells, long-term exposure to dopamine agonists promoted desensitization of D1B receptor but not that of D1A receptor. The inability of D1A receptor to desensitize was a result of the adenosine present in culture medium acting through activation of adenosine A1 receptors. Cell incubation with either adenosine deaminase, CGS-15943, a generic adenosine receptor antagonist, or the A1 antagonist DPCPX restored the long-term desensitization time-course of D1A receptors.

However, simultaneous activation of A1 and D1A receptors promoted a delayed D1A receptor desensitization.

Le récepteur D1A se caractérise par une baisse d'activité forte et biphasique, le récepteur D1B par un profil proche avec une amplitude plus faible conséquence de son activité constitutive.

Four D1 receptor subtypes (D1A, D1B/D5, D1C and D1D) were cloned until today in vertebrates. Evolutive analysis shows that D1A and D1B subtypes are the most conserved while D1C and D1D subtypes are missing in mammals. Despite this diversity, dopamine function in the whole organism cannot be assigned to one specific subtype action. For this reason, all along this work we have identified functional characters which may discriminate each of the subtypes and which help to understand why they were conserved in vertebrates. Desensitisation is one of the most important functional parameter of receptor cell biology. The D1A receptor desensitisation is characterised by a strong and biphasic decrease in activity. The D1B receptor exhibit a similar profile with a weaker amplitude due to its constitutive activity. The D1C receptor does not undergo any desensitisation. Construction of chimerical proteins between each of the D1 receptor subtypes and the GFP fluorescent protein allowed us to visualised the receptor during the desensitisation process. It shows that internalisation, of the D1 dopamine receptor does not occur in conjonction with the general process of desensitisation. These phenomenon are blurred by interaction with the A1 adenosine receptor. To conclude, the analysis of MAPK signalisation pathways show that ERK activation was fast and strong and differentiate each subtypes of the subtypes. Moreover, if the p38 pathway was only weakly activated, the JNK one does not show any activity. Thus, it appears so that differential activation and regulation of signalisation pathway discriminate D1 dopamine receptor subtypes in vertebrates.

We chose SIMKA [10] a fast kmer-based method initially developed to estimate the similarity between numerous metagenomic datasets, and which has been recently adapted to extract their common sequences. As our symbionts are identified, we used SIMKA to compare our holobionts transcriptomes to publicly available dinoflagellates transcriptomes [11] generating two datasets, one composed of reads from the symbionts and another with reads from the host (for which no reference data are currently available). Independent assemblies were then performed in parallel, accelerating the study process, and minimizing the proportion of resulting chimeric sequences. Our strategy produced a unique and comprehensive genomic dataset for Radiolaria [12, 13], and offers a pragmatic, large scale, comparison strategy to assemble and study holobionts [9]. Our new sequences obtained from holobionts study will be used for phylogenomics investigation, as reference for environmental metagenomic studies and ultimately to understand and characterize the molecular basis of symbiotic relationships in the plankton.</br></br> Bibliographic references</br></br> [1] Simon K.

During the last 50 years, the ascomycete Trichoderma reesei, the main source of industrial cellulase and hemicellulase cocktails, has been subjected to several rounds of classical mutagenesis with the aim to obtain higher production levels. During these random genetic events, strains unable to produce cellulases were generated. Here, whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic analyses of the cellulase-negative strain QM9978 were used for the identifcation of mutations underlying this cellulase-negative phenotype. Results: Sequence comparison of the cellulase-negative strain QM9978 to the reference strain QM6a identifed a total of 43 mutations, of which 33 were located either close to or in coding regions. From those, we identifed 23 single-nucleotide variants, nine InDels, and one translocation. The translocation occurred between chromosomes V and VII, is located upstream of the putative transcription factor vib1, and abolishes its expression in QM9978 as detected during the transcriptomic analyses. Ectopic expression of vib1 under the control of its native promoter as well as overexpression of vib1 under the control of a strong constitutive promoter restored cellulase expression in QM9978, thus confrming that the translocation event is the reason for the cellulase-negative phenotype. Gene deletion of vib1 in the moderate producer strain QM9414 and in the high producer strain Rut-C30 reduced cellulase expression in both cases. Overexpression of vib1 in QM9414 and Rut-C30 had no efect on cellulase production, most likely because vib1 is already expressed at an optimal level under normal conditions. Conclusion: We were able to establish a link between a chromosomal translocation in QM9978 and the cellulasenegative phenotype of the strain. We identifed the transcription factor vib1 as a key regulator of cellulases in T. reesei whose expression is absent in QM9978. We propose that in T. reesei, as in Neurospora crassa, vib1 is involved in cellulase induction, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.

Metagenomic and physiological studies have identified clades or ecotypes of marine phytoplankton that are specialized in iron depleted ecological niches. Although less studied, eukaryotic picophytoplankton does contribute significantly to primary production and carbon transfer to higher trophic levels. In particular, metagenomic studies of the green picoalga Ostreococcus have revealed the occurrence of two main clades distributed along coast-offshore gradients, suggesting niche partitioning in different nutrient regimes. Here, we present a study of the response to iron limitation of four Ostreococcus strains isolated from contrasted environments. Whereas the strains isolated in nutrient-rich waters showed high iron requirements, the oceanic strains could cope with lower iron concentrations. The RCC802 strain, in particular, was able to maintain high growth rate at low iron levels. Together physiological and transcriptomic data indicate that the competitiveness of RCC802 under iron limitation is related to a lowering of iron needs though a reduction of the photosynthetic machinery and of protein content, rather than to cell size reduction.

We used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomes of a CDR (Candida Drug Resistance) strain and its isogenic drug sensitive counterpart. RESULTS: RNA-seq unveiled differential expression of 228 genes including a) genes previously identified as involved in CDR, b) genes not previously associated to the CDR phenotype, and c) novel transcripts whose function as a gene is uncharacterized. In particular, we show for the first time that CDR acquisition is correlated with an overexpression of the transcription factor encoding gene CZF1. CZF1 null mutants were susceptible to many drugs, independently of known multidrug resistance mechanisms. We show that CZF1 acts as a repressor of beta-glucan synthesis, thus negatively regulating cell wall integrity. Finally, our RNA-seq data allowed us to identify a new transcribed region, upstream of the TAC1 gene, which encodes the major CDR transcriptional regulator. CONCLUSION: Our results open new perspectives of the role of Czf1 and of our understanding of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that lead to the acquisition of drug resistance in C. albicans, with potential for future improvements of therapeutic strategies.']",https://inserm.hal.science/inserm-00733893,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp']"

Several strains have been developed in the past using random mutagenesis, and despite impressive performance enhancements, the pressure for low-cost cellulases has stimulated continuous research in the field. In this context, comparative study of the lower and higher producer strains obtained through random mutagenesis using systems biology tools (genome and transcriptome sequencing) can shed light on the mechanisms of cellulase production and help identify genes linked to performance. Previously, our group published comparative genome sequencing of the lower and higher producer strains NG 14 and RUT C30. In this follow-up work, we examine how these mutations affect phenotype as regards the transcriptome and cultivation behaviour. Results: We performed kinetic transcriptome analysis of the NG 14 and RUT C30 strains of early enzyme production induced by lactose using bioreactor cultivations close to an industrial cultivation regime. RUT C30 exhibited both earlier onset of protein production (3 h) and higher steady-state productivity. A rather small number of genes compared to previous studies were regulated (568), most of them being specific to the NG 14 strain (319). Clustering analysis highlighted similar behaviour for some functional categories and allowed us to distinguish between induction-related genes and productivity-related genes. Cross-comparison of our transcriptome data with previously identified mutations revealed that most genes from our dataset have not been mutated. Interestingly, the few mutated genes belong to the same clusters, suggesting that these clusters contain genes playing a role in strain performance. Conclusions: This is the first kinetic analysis of a transcriptomic study carried out under conditions approaching industrial ones with two related strains of T. reesei showing distinctive cultivation behaviour. Our study sheds some light on some of the events occurring in these strains following induction by lactose. The fact that few regulated genes have been affected by mutagenesis suggests that the induction mechanism is essentially intact compared to that for the wild-type isolate QM6a and might be engineered for further improvement of T. reesei. Genes from two specific clusters might be potential targets for such genetic engineering.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01112360,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.bc']"

HSF2 deficiency resulted in a reduced number of radial glia fibers, the architectural guides for migrating neurons, and of Cajal-Retzius cells, which secrete the positioning signal Reelin. Therefore, we focused on the radial migration signaling pathways. The levels of Reelin and Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation were reduced, suggesting that the Reelin cascade is affected in Hsf2-/- cortices. The expression of p35, an activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), essential for radial migration, was dependent on the amount of HSF2 in gain- and loss-of-function systems. p39, another Cdk5 activator, displayed reduced mRNA levels in Hsf2-/- cortices, which, together with the lowered p35 levels, decreased Cdk5 activity. We demonstrate in vivo binding of HSF2 to the p35 promoter and thereby identify p35 as the first target gene for HSF2 in cortical development.

To learn how cellulase production was improved by these techniques, we performed massively parallel sequencing to identify mutations in the genomes of two hyperproducing strains (NG14, and its direct improved descendant, RUT C30).

One such wide-domain regulatory circuit, essential to all cells, is carbon catabolite repression (CCR): it allows the cell to prefer some carbon sources, whose assimilation is of high nutritional value, over less profitable ones. In lower multicellular fungi, the C2H2 zinc finger CreA/CRE1 protein has been shown to act as the transcriptional repressor in this process. However, the complete list of its gene targets is not known. RESULTS: Here, we deciphered the CRE1 regulatory range in the model cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading fungus Trichoderma reesei (anamorph of Hypocrea jecorina) by profiling transcription in a wild-type and a delta-cre1 mutant strain on glucose at constant growth rates known to repress and de-repress CCR-affected genes. Analysis of genome-wide microarrays reveals 2.8% of transcripts whose expression was regulated in at least one of the four experimental conditions: 47.3% of which were repressed by CRE1, whereas 29.0% were actually induced by CRE1, and 17.2% only affected by the growth rate but CRE1 independent. Among CRE1 repressed transcripts, genes encoding unknown proteins and transport proteins were overrepresented. In addition, we found CRE1-repression of nitrogenous substances uptake, components of chromatin remodeling and the transcriptional mediator complex, as well as developmental processes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first global insight into the molecular physiological response of a multicellular fungus to carbon catabolite regulation and identifies several not yet known targets in a growth-controlled environment.']",https://inserm.hal.science/inserm-00663944,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp']"

The ability to parasitize and/or kill other fungi (mycoparasitism) is used in plant protection against soil-borne fungal diseases (biological control, or biocontrol). To investigate mechanisms of mycoparasitism, we compared the transcriptional responses of cosmopolitan opportunistic species and powerful biocontrol agents Trichoderma atroviride and T. virens with tropical ecologically restricted species T. reesei during confrontations with a plant pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani. RESULTS: The three Trichoderma spp. exhibited a strikingly different transcriptomic response already before physical contact with alien hyphae. T. atroviride expressed an array of genes involved in production of secondary metabolites, GH16 Ss-glucanases, various proteases and small secreted cysteine rich proteins. T. virens, on the other hand, expressed mainly the genes for biosynthesis of gliotoxin, respective precursors and also glutathione, which is necessary for gliotoxin biosynthesis. In contrast, T. reesei increased the expression of genes encoding cellulases and hemicellulases, and of the genes involved in solute transport. The majority of differentially regulated genes were orthologues present in all three species or both in T. atroviride and T. virens, indicating that the regulation of expression of these genes is different in the three Trichoderma spp. The genes expressed in all three fungi exhibited a nonrandom genomic distribution, indicating a possibility for their regulation via chromatin modification. CONCLUSION: This genome-wide expression study demonstrates that the initial Trichoderma mycotrophy has differentiated into several alternative ecological strategies ranging from parasitism to predation and saprotrophy. It provides first insights into the mechanisms of interactions between Trichoderma and other fungi that may be exploited for further development of biofungicides.']",https://inserm.hal.science/inserm-00799174,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp']"

Analyzing at the global scale the genes networks involved in Si transport and metabolism is critical in order to elucidate Si biomineralization, and to understand diatoms contribution to biogeochemical cycles. Methodology/Principal Findings Using whole genome expression analyses we evaluated the transcriptional response to Si availability for the model species Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Among the differentially regulated genes we found genes involved in glutamine-nitrogen pathways, encoding putative extracellular matrix components, or involved in iron regulation. Some of these compounds may be good candidates for intracellular intermediates involved in silicic acid storage and/or intracellular transport, which are very important processes that remain mysterious in diatoms. Expression analyses and localization studies gave the first picture of the spatial distribution of a silicic acid transporter in a diatom model species, and support the existence of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Conclusions/Significance Our global analyses revealed that about one fourth of the differentially expressed genes are organized in clusters, underlying a possible evolution of P. tricornutum genome, and perhaps other pennate diatoms, toward a better optimization of its response to variable environmental stimuli. High fitness and adaptation of diatoms to various Si levels in marine environments might arise in part by global regulations from gene (expression level) to genomic (organization in clusters, dosage compensation by gene duplication), and by post-transcriptional regulation and spatial distribution of SIT proteins.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-02879344,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.bibs']"

The two dopamine receptor classes display different structures, interact with different regulatory partners (including heterotrimeric G proteins) and, accordingly, have independent evolutionary origins. In vertebrates, each of these receptor classes comprises several subtypes, generated by two steps of gene duplications, early in vertebrate evolution. In the D1 receptor class, the D1A, D1B, D1C and D1D subtypes, and in the D2 class, the D2, D3 and D4 receptor subtypes have been conserved in most vertebrate groups. This conservation has been driven by the acquisition, by each receptor subtype, of a small number of specific properties, which were selected for adaptive purpose in vertebrates. Among these properties, affinity for dopamine, the natural ligand, intrinsic receptor activity, and agonist-induced desensitization clearly distinguish the receptor subtypes. In addition, each dopamine receptor subtype is addressed to a specific location within neuronal networks, although detailed information is lacking for several receptor subtypes. Receptors localization at diverse subcellular places in neurons may also differ from one subtype to another, resulting in different ways of regulating cell signalisation. One challenge for future research on dopamine and its receptors would be to identify the nature of the protein partners and the molecular mechanisms involved in localizing receptors to the neuronal plasma membrane. In this respect, the evolutionary approach we have undertaken suggests that, due to gene duplications, a reasonable degree of freedom exists in the tight organisation of dopamine receptors in neurons.

The localisation and phenotype of dopamine-synthesizing neurones is determined by different gene networks in each of the dopaminergic nuclei. However, despite this amazing diversity, the overall organisation of the dopaminergic nuclei is strinkingly conserved in the main vertebrates groups. In sharp contrast, the number of dopamine receptors subtypes has been multiplied by two major steps of gene duplications during vertebrates evolution. The first one occurred in the lineage leading to agnathans, whereas the second was concomitant to the emergence of cartilaginous fish. Accordingly, three subtypes exist in D1 receptor class (D1A, D1B, D1C) in all the jawed vertebrates, with two exceptions: eutherian mammals where only two D1 subtypes are found (D1A, D1B) and archosaurs where a fourth subtype is present (D1D). Comparisons of the pharmacological and biochemical characteristics of the dopamine receptors in vertebrate groups revealed homologous features that define each of the receptor subtypes and that have been fixed after gene duplications.

The production of chimeric sequences and our inability to distinguish the taxonomic origins of the sequences produced are inherent and recurrent difficulties in de novo assembly analyses. As the study of holobiont meta-transcriptomes is affected by challenges invoked above, we propose an innovative bioinformatic approach to tackle such difficulties and tested it on marine models as a proof of concept. Results: We considered three holobiont models, of which two transcriptomes were previously published and a yet unpublished transcriptome, to analyze and sort their raw reads using Short Read Connector, a k-mer based similarity method. Before assembly, we thus defined four distinct categories for each holobiont meta-transcriptome: host reads, symbiont reads, shared reads, and unassigned reads. Afterwards, we observed that independent de novo assemblies for each category led to a diminution of the number of chimeras compared to classical assembly methods. Moreover, the separation of each partner’ s transcriptome offered the independent and comparative exploration of their functional diversity in the holobiont. Finally, our strategy allowed to propose new functional annotations for two well-studied holobionts (a Cnidaria-Dinophyta, a Porifera-Bacteria) and a first meta-transcriptome from a planktonic Radiolaria-Dinophyta system forming widespread symbiotic association for which our knowledge is considerably limited. Conclusions: In contrast to classical assembly approaches, our bioinformatic strategy generates less de novo assembled chimera and allows biologists to study separately host and symbiont data from a holobiont mixture. The pre-assembly separation of reads using an efficient tool as Short Read Connector is an effective way to tackle meta-transcriptomic challenges and offers bright perpectives to study holobiont systems composed of either well-studied or poorly characterized symbiotic lineages and ultimately expand our knowledge about these associations.']",https://hal.science/hal-01643153v2,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.ee', '2.sdv.ee.ieo', '0.info', '1.info.info-bi']"

One of the astroglial molecule involved in these regulations might be Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein highly enriched in astrocyte perivascular endfeet-terminated processes forming the glia limitans. Indeed, Cx43 deletion in astrocytes (Cx43KO) promotes a continuous immune recruitment and an autoimmune response against an astrocyte protein, without inducing any brain lesion. To investigate the molecular basis of this unique immune response, we characterized the polysomal transcriptome of hippocampal astrocytes deleted for Cx43. Our results demonstrate that, in the absence of Cx43, astrocytes adopt an atypical reactive status with no change in most canonical astrogliosis markers, but with an upregulation of molecules promoting immune recruitment, complement activation as well as anti-inflammatory processes. Intriguingly, while several of these upregulated transcriptional events suggested an activation of the γ-interferon pathway, no increase in this cytokine or activation of related signaling pathways were found in Cx43KO. Finally, deletion of astroglial Cx43 was associated with the upregulation of several angiogenic factors, consistent with an increase in microvascular density in Cx43KO brains.

Finally, systematic mutagenesis of the position 2 in a prototypal yeast mitochondrial protein confirmed its critical role in mitochondrial protein import. Our work highlights the hydrophobicity of MTS N-terminal residues and their modification by NatC as critical features for the definition of the mitochondrial proteome, providing a molecular explanation for mitochondrial defects observed in yeast or human NatC-depleted cells. Functional mapping of N-terminal residues thus has the potential to support the discovery of novel mechanisms of protein regulation or targeting.']",https://hal.science/hal-03789894,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.bibs']"

Current procedures to isolate them cannot specifically separate their distinct subtypes, in particular vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and mid-capillary pericytes (mcPCs), which differ among others by their expression of smooth muscle actin (SMA). We herein describe an innovative method allowing SMA+ VSMCs and SMA- mcPCs to be freshly isolated from the rat cerebral cortex. Using differential RNA-Seq analysis, we then reveal the specific gene expression profile of each subtype. Our results refine the current description of the role of VSMCs in parenchymal cortical arterioles at the molecular level and provide a unique platform to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the specific functions of mcPCs in the brain vasculature.']",https://hal.science/hal-03908519,['0.sdv']
