We have explored whether less comprehensive versions of the simulation could still provide relevant results. The non‐Newtonian blood model is necessary to predict the hemodynamics in the AVF because of the predominance of low shear rates in the vein. An uncoupled fluid simulation provides informative qualitative maps of the hemodynamic conditions in the AVF; quantitatively, the hemodynamic parameters are accurate within 20% maximum. Conversely, an uncoupled structural simulation with non‐uniform wall properties along the vasculature provides the accurate distribution of internal wall stresses, but only at one instant of time within the cardiac cycle.

The microcapsules are fabricated by cross-linking of human serum albumin (HSA) with concentrations from 15 to 35 % (w/v). A wide range of capsule radii (∼40–450 μm) is obtained by varying the stirring speed in the emulsification step. For each stirring speed, a low threshold value in protein concentration is found, below which no coherent capsules could be produced. The smaller the stirring speed, the lower the concentration can be. Increasing the concentration from the threshold value and considering capsules of a given size, we show that the surface shear modulus of the membrane increases with the concentration following a sigmoidal curve. The increase in mechanical resistance reveals a higher degree of cross-linking in the membrane. Varying the stirring speed, we find that the surface shear modulus strongly increases with the capsule radius: its increase is two orders of magnitude larger than the increase in size for the capsules under consideration.

We study the influence of the interspacing on the capsule path selection at the channel bifurcation using a three-dimensional immersed boundary–lattice Boltzmann method. Our objectives are to establish a phase diagram and identify the critical interspacing above which hydrodynamic interaction between capsules no longer affects their path selection. We find two main regimes. At low interspacing, strong capsule interaction leads to an unsteady regime for which the capsule path selection follows either a periodic or a disordered state. Above a critical initial interspacing $d_{ct}$ , a steady regime is achieved where interaction between capsules is too weak to affect their path selection. The capsules then follow an identical steady trajectory. We find that the dependence of the interspacing $d_{ct}$ , normalised by the capsule radius, on the flow split ratio falls onto a universal curve regardless of the flow strength, capsule size and membrane shear elasticity.

Cell culture in the microfluidic biochip for 96 h including 72 h of perfusion provoked a 24 h delay in cell growth compared to plate cultures. Inside the microfluidic biochip, few apoptosis, and necrosis were detected along the culture and 3D cell organization was observed.

A transcriptomic analysis performed at 96 h of culture using Affymetrix GeneChip demonstrated that 1,025 genes with a fold change above 1.8 were statistically differentially expressed in the microfluidic biochip cultures compared to plate cultures. Among those genes, phase I enzymes involved in the xenobiotic's metabolism such as the cytochromes P450 (CYP) 1A1/2, 2B6, 3A4, 3A5, and 3A7 were up-regulated. The CYP1A1/2 up-regulation was associated with the appearance of CYP1A1/2's activity evidenced by using EROD biotransformation assay. Several phase II enzymes such as sulfotransferases (SULT1A1 and SULT1A2), UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT1A1, UGT2B7) and phase III transporters (such as MDR1, MRP2) were also up-regulated.

The liver was modeled using HepG2/C3a and HepaRG cell lines and the kidney using MDCK cell lines. To demonstrate the synergic interaction between both organs, we investigated the effect of ifosfamide, an anticancerous drug. Ifosfamide is a prodrug which is metabolized by the liver to isophosforamide mustard, an active metabolite. This metabolism process also leads to the formation of chloroacetaldehyde, a nephrotoxic metabolite and acrolein a urotoxic one. In the biochips of MDCK cultures, we did not detect any nephrotoxic effects after 72\u2009h of 50\u2009µM ifosfamide exposure. However, in the liver-kidney biochips, the same 72\u2009h exposure leads to a nephrotoxicity illustrated by a reduction of the number of MDCK cells (up to 30% in the HepaRG-MDCK) when compared to untreated co-cultures or treated MDCK monocultures. The reduction of the MDCK cell number was not related to a modification of the cell cycle repartition in ifosfamide treated cases when compared to controls. The ifosfamide biotransformation into 3-dechloroethylifosfamide, an equimolar byproduct of the chloroacetaldehyde production, was detected by mass spectrometry at a rate of apparition of 0.3\u2009±\u20090.1 and 1.1\u2009±\u20090.3\u2009pg/h/biochips in HepaRG monocultures and HepaRG-MDCK co-cultures respectively. Any metabolite was detected in HepG2/C3a cultures. Furthermore, the ifosfamide treatment in HepaRG-MDCK co-culture system triggered an increase in the intracellular calcium release in MDCK cells on contrary to the treatment on MDCK monocultures. As 3-dechloroethylifosfamide is not toxic, we have tested the effect of equimolar choloroacetaldehyde concentration onto the MDCK cells. At this concentration, we found a quite similar calcium perturbation and MDCK nephrotoxicity via a reduction of 30% of final cell numbers such as in the ifosfamide HepaRG-MDCK co-culture experiments. Our results suggest that ifosfamide nephrotoxicity in a liver-kidney micro fluidic co-culture model using HepaRG-MDCK cells is induced by the metabolism of ifosfamide into chloroacetaldehyde whereas this pathway is not functional in HepG2/C3a-MDCK model.

The cellular response was analyzed by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify cell-specific molecule-response markers. The metabolic response to flutamide results in a disruption of glucose homeostasis and in mitochondrial dysfunctions. This flutamide-specific metabolic response was illustrated by a reduction of the extracellular glucose and fructose consumptions and a general reduction of the tricarboxylic acid cycle activity leading to the reduction of the consumption of several amino acids. We also found a higher production of 3-hydroxybutyrate and lactate, and the reduction of the albumin production compared with controls. The toxic metabolic signature associated with the active metabolite HF was illustrated by a high-energy demand and an increase in several amino acid metabolism. Finally, for both molecules, the hepatotoxicity was correlated to the glutathione (GSH) metabolism illustrated by the levels of the 2-hydroxybutyrate and pyroglutamate productions and the increase of the glutamate and glycine productions. Thus, the entire set of results contributed to extract specific mechanistic toxic signatures and their relation to hepatotoxicity, which appeared consistent with literature reports.

Several studies have pointed out that the quality of signal processing – and hence the interpretation of measurement results – is affected significantly by the choice of measurement technique and the presence of non-stationary frequency content in EHG signals. To our knowledge, the effect of time variance on the quality of EHG signal processing has never been fully investigated. How best to process EHG signals with the goal of distinguishing labor-induced contractions from their harmless, pre-labor cousins, remains an open question. Method Our methodology is based on three pillars. The first consists of a new method for EHG preprocessing in which we apply a second-order Butterworth filter to retain only the EHG fast-wave, low-frequency band (FWL), then use a bivariate piecewise stationary pre-segmentation (bPSP) algorithm to segment the EHG signal into stationary parts. The second pillar addresses the estimation of connectivity and directionality using three methods: nonlinear correlation coefficient (h2), general synchronization (H), and Granger causality (GC). The third pillar is related to signal classification and discrimination between pregnancy and labor using receiver operating curves (ROC) and connectivity and direction maps. For this purpose, we analyze the impact of four factors on data processing efficiency: i) method of connectivity detection, ii) effect of piecewise stationary segmentation preprocessing, iii) retained frequency content and iv) electrode configuration used for EHG recording (bipolar vs. unipolar). Results Our results show that piecewise signal segmentation and filtering considerably improves classification performance and statistical significance for some connectivity methods, in particular the h2. To this end we propose a new approach (detailed below) for h2 called Filtered-Windowed (FW) h2 that better highlights the differences between pregnancy and labor in the connectivity matrix and directionality maps. Conclusions This is the first comparative study of the effects of multiple processing factors on connectivity measurement efficiency. Our results indicate that appropriate preprocessing can improve the differentiation of pregnancy and labor-induced contraction signals and may lead to innovative applications in the prevention of preterm labor.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-03329927,"['0.info', '0.sdv']","['Electrohysterogram' 'Signal Processing' 'Uterine Contractions'

However, this generates new gradient-induced potential (GIP) morphologies. These induced potentials (IPs) pollute the electrophysiological signals possibly recorded simultaneously. Several algorithms developed to eliminate this noise rely on modelling the shape of the IP. As each new sequence has a different shape of IP, it might be interesting to find a mathematical approach to building sequence-specific models. In this article, we present a preliminary study that includes wavelet decomposition of contaminated electrocardiographic (ECG) to extract IP morphologies and whose time-frequency characterization allows the elaboration of a harmonic model, using sinusoidal decomposition. Method: The in vitro IPs are used to select analyzing wavelets. A broadband sensor (3.5Khz), placed inside a 3 T MRI scanner, is used to collect 3-lead ECGs while activating three sequences that generate very high noise levels. The in vivo IPs extracted from the polluted ECGs are characterized to verify their quasi-periodicity. Parameters of the sinusoidal model (amplitude, frequency, phase) are estimated using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfard-Shano optimization algorithm. Result: Four wavelets (sym7, coif3, bior2.2, bior3.3) showed efficient in vivo IP extraction results. Three evaluation criteria for the modelling algorithm, allowing the calculated models to be compared with the shapes of the extracted IPs, showed promising results. For example, for the chosen efficiency criterion Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency , the values obtained for the three leads are between 0.99980 and 1. Conclusion: Promising preliminary results have been obtained for the extraction on modelling of different IPs from noisy ECG signals. Continuing this preliminary study on more MRI sequences and subjects could help build a database of IP models to initiate deep learning filtering. Since these models are sequence-specific and integrate the distribution of induced voltages on the body surface, we hope to find a generic relationship that enables the prediction of IPs by new sequences and anticipate the development of purification algorithms in a near future.']",https://hal.utc.fr/hal-04466519,['0.spi'],"['MR Imaging' 'MRI Sequences' 'Gradient-Induced Potential'

In the second study, HCs comprised a majority of aged-matched siblings of patients with known HLA-B27 status. Alpha and beta diversities were assessed using QIIME, and comparisons were performed using linear discriminant analysis effect size to examine differences between groups. Results In both cohorts, dysbiosis was evidenced in SpA and RA, as compared with HCs, and was disease specific. A restriction of microbiota biodiversity was detected in both disease groups. The most striking change was a twofold to threefold increased abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus in SpA, as compared with both RA and HCs that was significant in both studies and positively correlated with disease activity in patients having a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Among HCs, significant difference in microbiota composition were also detected between HLA-B27+ and HLA-B27 negative siblings, suggesting that genetic background may influence gut microbiota composition. Conclusion Our results suggest that distinctive dysbiosis characterise both SpA and RA and evidence a reproducible increase in R. gnavus that appears specific for SpA and a marker of disease activity.

Mucosa-associated microbiota could have a key role in induction of host immunity and in inflammatory process.

Here we analysed the bacterial and fungal composition of the mucosa-associated microbiota of Crohn's disease patients and healthy subjects. Methods: Our prospective, observational study evaluated bacterial and fungal composition of mucosa-associated microbiota of 23 Crohn's disease patients [16 in flare, 7 in remission] and 10 healthy subjects, using 16S [MiSeq] and ITS2 [pyrosequencing] sequencing, respectively. Global fungal load was assessed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Bacterial microbiota in Crohn's disease patients was characterised by a restriction in biodiversity. with an increase of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria. Global fungus load was significantly increased in Crohn's disease flare compared with healthy subjects [p < 0.05]. In both groups, the colonic mucosa-associated fungal microbiota was dominated by Basidiomycota and Ascomycota phyla. Cystofilobasidiaceae family and Candida glabrata species were overrepresented in Crohn's disease. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Filobasidium uniguttulatum species were associated with non-inflamed mucosa, whereas Xylariales order was associated with inflamed mucosa.

In that context, we aimed to describe nutrition practices in the ICU and study the association between the introduction of early nutrition support (<\u200948\xa0h) in the ICU and patient mortality at day 28 (D28) using data from a multicentre prospective cohort. Methods The ‘French-Speaking ICU Nutritional Survey’ (FRANS) study was conducted in 26 ICUs in France and Belgium over 3\xa0months in 2015. Adult patients with a predicted ICU length of stay\u2009>\u20093\xa0days were consecutively included and followed for 10\xa0days. Their mortality was assessed at D28. We investigated the association between early nutrition (<\u200948\xa0h) and mortality at D28 using univariate and multivariate propensity-score-weighted logistic regression analyses. Results During the study period, 1206 patients were included. Early nutrition support was administered to 718 patients (59.5%), with 504 patients receiving enteral nutrition and 214 parenteral nutrition. Early nutrition was more frequently prescribed in the presence of multiple organ failure and less frequently in overweight and obese patients. Early nutrition was significantly associated with D28 mortality in the univariate analysis (crude odds ratio (OR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23–2.34) and propensity-weighted multivariate analysis (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.05, 95% CI 1.00–1.10). In subgroup analyses, this association was stronger in patients\u2009≤\u200965\xa0years and with SOFA scores\u2009≤\u20098. Compared with no early nutrition, a significant association was found of D28 mortality with early enteral (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.11) but not early parenteral nutrition (aOR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98–1.11). Conclusions In this prospective cohort study, early nutrition support in the ICU was significantly associated with increased mortality at D28, particularly in younger patients with less severe disease. Compared to no early nutrition, only early enteral nutrition appeared to be associated with increased mortality. Such findings are in contrast with current guidelines on the provision of early nutrition support in the ICU and may challenge our current practices, particularly concerning patients at low nutrition risk.

Methods Single-centre cohort performed from 3 March 2020 to 14 April 2020 in four intensive care units in Bordeaux University Hospital, France. All patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary severity criteria were included. AKI was defined using Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. A systematic urinary analysis was performed. The incidence, severity, clinical presentation, biological characterization (transient versus persistent AKI; proteinuria, haematuria and glycosuria) and short-term outcomes were evaluated. Results Seventy-one patients were included, with basal serum creatinine (SCr) of 69 ± 21 µmol/L. At admission, AKI was present in 8/71 (11%) patients. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] follow-up was 17 (12–23) days. AKI developed in a total of 57/71 (80%) patients, with 35% Stage 1, 35% Stage 2 and 30% Stage 3 AKI; 10/57 (18%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Recent studies have suggested that the extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o) concentration gradient present near the bone environment may be one of the participating factors, producing a chemoattractant effect on osteoclast precursors. Using the murine osteoclast precursor cells of the monocyte–macrophage lineage, the RAW 264.7 cell line, we have shown that Ca2+o increases the migration of these cells in a directional manner. The participation of the calcium sensing receptor (CaR) in this effect was tested by knocking down its expression through RNA interference, which resulted in an abolition of the migratory response. By the use of specific pathway inhibitors and western blot analysis, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and phospholipase Cβ pathways were shown to be implicated in the migratory effect. The implication of the Akt pathway in the Ca2+o-induced chemoattraction of RAW 264.7 cells was also confirmed by transducing the cells with the fusion protein TAT-dominant negative-Akt, which decreased the migratory effect. In contrast, the MAPK pathways (ERK1/2, p38 and JNK) were not involved in the production of the migratory effect. We conclude that through the activation of the CaR and subsequent signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway, Ca2+o produces a chemoattractant effect on the osteoclast precursor RAW 264.7 cells.

In the absence of AGN feedback, large amounts of stars accumulate in the central galaxies to form overly massive, blue, compact and rotation-dominated galaxies. Powerful AGN jets transform the central galaxies into red extended and dispersion-dominated galaxies. This morphological transformation of disc galaxies into elliptical galaxies is driven by the efficient quenching of the in situ star formation due to AGN feedback, which transform these galaxies into systems built up by accretion. For galaxies mainly formed by accretion, the proportion of stars deposited farther away from the centre increases, and galaxies have larger sizes. The accretion is also directly responsible for randomizing the stellar orbits, increasing the amount of dispersion over rotation of stars as a function of time.

GREAT3 was divided into experiments to test three specific questions, and included simulated space- and ground-based data with constant or cosmologically varying shear fields. The simplest (control) experiment included parametric galaxies with a realistic distribution of signal-to-noise, size, and ellipticity, and a complex point spread function (PSF). The other experiments tested the additional impact of realistic galaxy morphology, multiple exposure imaging, and the uncertainty about a spatially varying PSF; the last two questions will be explored in Paper II. The 24 participating teams competed to estimate lensing shears to within systematic error tolerances for upcoming Stage-IV dark energy surveys, making 1525 submissions overall. GREAT3 saw considerable variety and innovation in the types of methods applied. Several teams now meet or exceed the targets in many of the tests conducted (to within the statistical errors). We conclude that the presence of realistic galaxy morphology in simulations changes shear calibration biases by ∼1 per cent for a wide range of methods. Other effects such as truncation biases due to finite galaxy postage stamps, and the impact of galaxy type as measured by the Sérsic index, are quantified for the first time.

Density-estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) methods turn inference into a density-estimation task on a set of simulated data-parameter pairs, and give orders of magnitude improvements over traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference. In this paper, we use neural density estimators (NDEs) to learn the likelihood function from a set of simulated data sets, with active learning to adaptively acquire simulations in the most relevant regions of parameter space on the fly. We demonstrate the approach on a number of cosmological case studies, showing that for typical problems high-fidelity posterior inference can be achieved with just |$\\mathcal {O}(10^3)$| simulations or fewer. In addition to enabling efficient simulation-based inference, for simple problems where the form of the likelihood is known, DELFI offers a fast alternative to Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, giving orders of magnitude speed-up in some cases.

In this paper, we use massive asymptotically optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the data space to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal framework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly, we present the first cosmological application of Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference (delfi), which learns a parametrized model for joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter posterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple, requires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-fidelity posteriors from orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it enables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously. We demonstrate delfi with massive data compression on an analysis of the joint light-curve analysis supernova data, as a simple validation case study. We show that high-fidelity posterior inference is possible for full-scale cosmological data analyses with as few as ∼10^4 simulations, with substantial scope for further improvement, demonstrating the scalability of likelihood-free inference to large and complex cosmological data sets.']",https://hal.science/hal-01703719,"['0.phys', '1.phys.astr']","['statistical models' 'cosmology' 'likelihood-free inference'

We detect a clear mass transition: the spin of dark matter haloes above a critical mass M0s≈5(±1)×1012 M tends to be perpendicular to the closest large-scale filament (with an excess probability of up to 12 per cent), and aligned with the intermediate axis of the tidal tensor (with an excess probability of up to 40 per cent), whereas the spin of low-mass haloes is more likely to be aligned with the closest filament (with an excess probability of up to 15 per cent). Furthermore, this critical mass is redshift-dependent, scaling as M crit s(z)≈M0s(1+z)-γs with γ<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.5 ± 0.2. A similar fit for the redshift evolution of the tidal tensor transition mass yields M0t≈8(±2)×1012 M and γ<SUB>t</SUB> = 3 ± 0.3. This critical mass also varies weakly with the scale defining filaments. <P />We propose an interpretation of this signal in terms of large-scale cosmic flows. In this picture, most low-mass haloes are formed through the winding of flows embedded in misaligned walls; hence, they acquire a spin parallel to the axis of the resulting filaments forming at the intersection of these walls. On the other hand, more massive haloes are typically the products of later mergers along such filaments, and thus they acquire a spin perpendicular to this direction when their orbital angular momentum is converted into spin. We show that this scenario is consistent with both measured excess probabilities of alignment with respect to the eigendirections of the tidal tensor, and halo merger histories. On a more qualitative level, it also seems compatible with 3D visualization of the structure of the cosmic web as traced by 'smoothed' dark matter simulations or gas tracer particles.

A resolution of up to 34\u2006pc, which is typical of individual zoom-in, up-to-date resimulated halos, is reached within galaxies; this allows the simulation to capture the multi-phase nature of the interstellar medium and the clumpy nature of the star formation process in galaxies. In this introductory paper, we present several key fundamental properties of galaxies and their black holes, including the galaxy mass function, cosmic star formation rate, galactic metallicities, the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation, the stellar-to-halo mass relation, galaxy sizes, stellar kinematics and morphology, gas content within galaxies and its kinematics, and the black hole mass and spin properties over time. The various scaling relations are broadly reproduced by NEWHORIZON with some differences with the standard observables. Owing to its exquisite spatial resolution, NEWHORIZON captures the inefficient process of star formation in galaxies, which evolve over time from being more turbulent, gas rich, and star bursting at high redshift. These high-redshift galaxies are also more compact, and they are more elliptical and clumpier until the level of internal gas turbulence decays enough to allow for the formation of discs.

The interest in this model has recently been boosted by the latest chemical composition measurements of cosmic rays, that seem to show the presence of a heavy nuclear component at the highest energies. Neutrons stars, with their metal-rich surfaces, are potentially interesting sources of such nuclei, but some open issues remain: 1) is it possible to extract these nuclei from the star's surface? 2) Do the nuclei survive the severe conditions present in the magnetosphere of the neutron star? 3) What happens to the surviving nuclei once they enter the wind that is launched outside the light cylinder? In this paper we address these issues in a quantitative way, proving that for the most reasonable range of neutron star surface temperatures (T<10<SUP>7</SUP> K), a large fraction of heavy nuclei survive photo-disintegration losses. These processes, together with curvature losses and acceleration in the star's electric potential, lead to injection of nuclei with a chemical composition that is mixed, even if only iron is extracted from the surface. We show that under certain conditions the chemical composition injected into the wind region is compatible with that required in previous work based on purely phenomenological arguments (typically ~50% protons, ~30% CNO and ~20% Fe), and provides a reasonable explanation of the mass abundance inferred from ultra high energy data.""]",https://insu.hal.science/insu-03644884,['0.sdu'],"['Neutron stars' 'Ultrahigh energy cosmic rays' 'Young' 'Fast-rotating'

Using 2D particle-in-cell simulations, we study proton acceleration in axisymmetric pulsar magnetospheres. Protons and electrons are extracted from the neutron star surface by the strong electric field induced by the rotation of the star, and electrons and positrons are produced in the magnetosphere through pair production process. As pair production has a crucial impact on electromagnetic fields, on gaps and thus on particle acceleration, we study its influence on the maximum energy and luminosity of protons escaping the magnetosphere. Protons are accelerated and escape in all our simulations. However, the acceleration sites are different for the protons and the pairs. As shown in previous studies, pairs are accelerated to their highest energies at the Y-point and in the equatorial current sheet, where magnetic reconnection plays an important role. In contrast, protons gain most of their kinetic energy below the light-cylinder radius within the separatrix current layers, but they are not confined within the equatorial current sheet. Their maximum Lorentz factors can reach 15% to 75% of the maximum Lorentz factor obtained by acceleration through the full vacuum potential drop from pole to equator, and increase with decreasing pair production. Their luminosity can reach 0.2% to 4% of the theoretical spin down luminosity of an aligned pulsar, and the minimum luminosity is obtained at the transition between the force-free and electrosphere regimes.

BH formation, occurring at early cosmic times, must account for the properties of BHs in today's galaxies, notably why some galaxies host a BH, and others do not. We investigate the formation, distribution and growth of BH 'seeds' by using the adaptive mesh refinement code ramses. We develop an implementation of BH formation in dense, low-metallicity environments, as advocated by models invoking the collapse of the first generation of stars, or of dense nuclear star clusters. The seed masses are computed one-by-one on-the-fly, based on the star formation rate and the stellar initial mass function. This self-consistent method to seed BHs allows us to study the distribution of BHs in a cosmological context and their evolution over cosmic time. We find that all high-mass galaxies tend to host a BH, whereas low-mass counterparts have a lower probability of hosting a BH. After the end of the epoch of BH formation, this probability is modulated by the growth of the galaxy. The simulated BHs connect to low-redshift observational samples, and span a similar range in accretion properties as Lyman-break analogs. The growth of BHs in low-mass galaxies is stunted by strong supernova (SN) feedback. The properties of BHs in dwarf galaxies thus remain a testbed for BH formation. Simulations with strong SN feedback, which is able to quench BH accretion in shallow potential wells, produce galaxies and BHs in better agreement with observational constraints.""]",https://insu.hal.science/insu-03747457,"['0.sdu', '0.sdu', '1.sdu.astr']","['Massive black holes' 'Black hole seeds' 'Galaxy' 'Supernova feedback'

We find that SN explosions can efficiently regulate star formation, leading to the stellar mass and metallicity consistent with the observed mass-metallicity relation and stellar mass-halo mass relation at z ∼ 3. This is achieved by making three important changes to the classical feedback scheme: (i) the different phases of SN blast waves are modelled directly by injecting radial momentum expected at each stage, (ii) the realistic time delay of SNe is required to disperse very dense gas before a runaway collapse sets in, and (iii) a non-uniform density distribution of the interstellar medium (ISM) is taken into account below the computational grid scale for the cell in which an SN explodes. The simulated galaxy with the SN feedback model shows strong outflows, which carry approximately 10 times larger mass than star formation rate, as well as smoothly rising circular velocity. Although the metallicity of the outflow depends sensitively on the feedback model used, we find that the accretion rate and metallicity of the cold flow around the virial radius is impervious to SN feedback.

We find that in the high-redshift universe galaxies maintain large values of gas accretion on to BHs, which therefore is the main driver of their mass and spin evolution. Sustained accretion of cold gas at high redshift tends to align BH spins with the angular momentum of the surrounding gas and maximize their magnitude.

Direct collapse, however, appears to be rare, as the conditions required by the scenario are that gas is metal-free, the presence of a strong photodissociating Lyman–Werner flux, and large inflows of gas at the centre of the halo, sustained for 10–100 Myr. We performed several cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that cover a large range of box sizes and resolutions, thus allowing us to understand the impact of several physical processes on the distribution of direct collapse BHs. We identify haloes where direct collapse can happen, and derive the number density of BHs. We also investigate the discrepancies between hydrodynamical simulations, direct or post-processed, and semi-analytical studies. Under optimistic assumptions, we find that for direct collapse to account for BHs in normal galaxies, the critical Lyman–Werner flux required for direct collapse must be about two orders of magnitude lower than predicted by 3D simulations that include detailed chemical models.

This process results in the formation of very compact bulges with specific angular momentum a factor of 5-30 smaller than the average angular momentum of the baryons in the whole halo. Such low angular momentum originates from both segregation and effective cancellation when the gas flows to the centre of the halo along well-defined cold filamentary streams. These filaments penetrate deep inside the halo and connect to the bulge from multiple rapidly changing directions. Structures falling in along the filaments (satellite galaxies) or formed by gravitational instabilities triggered by the inflow (star clusters) further reduce the angular momentum of the gas in the bulge. Finally, the fraction of gas radially falling to the centre appears to increase with the mass of the halo; we argue that this is most likely due to an enhanced cancellation of angular momentum in rarer haloes which are fed by more isotropically distributed cold streams.

METHODS: In the Compassionate Use of Protease Inhibitors in Viral C Cirrhosis study, 511 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and compensated cirrhosis who did not respond to a prior course of peginterferon and ribavirin (44.3% relapsers or patients with viral breakthrough, 44.8% partial responders, and 8.0% null responders) were given either telaprevir (n\xa0= 299) or boceprevir (n\xa0= 212) for 48 weeks. We assessed percentages of patients with sustained viral responses 12 weeks after therapy and safety. This observational study did not allow for direct comparison of the 2 regimens. RESULTS: Among patients given telaprevir, 74.2% of relapsers, 40.0% of partial responders, and 19.4% of null responders achieved SVR12. Among those given boceprevir, 53.9% of relapsers, 38.3% of partial responders, and none of the null responders achieved SVR12. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with SVR12 included prior response to treatment response, no lead-in phase, HCV subtype 1b (vs 1a), and baseline platelet count greater than 100,000/mm(3). Severe adverse events occurred in 49.9% of cases, including liver decompensation, severe infections in 10.4%, and death in 2.2%. In multivariate analysis, baseline serum albumin level less than 35 g/L and baseline platelet counts of 100,000/mm(3) or less predicted severe side effects or death. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively high percentages of real-life, treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and cirrhosis respond to the combination of peginterferon and ribavirin with telaprevir or boceprevir. However, side effects are frequent and often severe. Baseline levels of albumin and platelet counts can be used to guide treatment decisions.

Estimating the expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. Methods: We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in Île-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown, and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing. Results: We estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81% reduction of the average number of contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case finding and isolation are required for social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints. Conclusions: As France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity.

We propose an efficient yet effective machine learning approach to synthesize gestures driven by prosodic features and text in the style of different speakers including those unseen during training. Our model performs zero-shot multimodal style transfer driven by multimodal data from the PATS database containing videos of various speakers. We view style as being pervasive; while speaking, it colors the communicative behaviors expressivity while speech content is carried by multimodal signals and text. This disentanglement scheme of content and style allows us to directly infer the style embedding even of a speaker whose data are not part of the training phase, without requiring any further training or fine-tuning. The first goal of our model is to generate the gestures of a source speaker based on the content of two input modalities–Mel spectrogram and text semantics. The second goal is to condition the source speaker's predicted gestures on the multimodal behavior style embedding of a target speaker. The third goal is to allow zero-shot style transfer of speakers unseen during training without re-training the model. Our system consists of two main components: (1) a speaker style encoder network that learns to generate a fixed-dimensional speaker embedding style from a target speaker multimodal data (mel-spectrogram, pose, and text) and (2) a sequence-to-sequence synthesis network that synthesizes gestures based on the content of the input modalities—text and mel-spectrogram—of a source speaker and conditioned on the speaker style embedding. We evaluate that our model is able to synthesize gestures of a source speaker given the two input modalities and transfer the knowledge of target speaker style variability learned by the speaker style encoder to the gesture generation task in a zero-shot setup, indicating that the model has learned a high-quality speaker representation.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of meiofauna-sized organisms, such as Foraminifera, was proposed to overcome the drawbacks of macrofauna-based benthic monitoring. Here, we tested the application of foraminiferal metabarcoding to benthic monitoring of salmon farms in Norway.

The foraminiferal diversity increased with the distance to fish cages, and metabarcoding provides an assessment of the ecological quality comparable to the morphological analyses.

When the domain is known, i.e., when its states, actions and reward are defined, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a convenient theoretical framework to formalize RL. But in an open-ended learning process, an agent or robot must solve an unbounded sequence of tasks that are not known in advance and the corresponding MDPs cannot be built at design time. This defines the main challenges of open-ended learning: how can the agent learn how to behave appropriately when the adequate states, actions and rewards representations are not given? In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to address this question. We assume an agent endowed with low-level perception and action capabilities. This agent receives an external reward when it faces a task. It must discover the state and action representations that will let it cast the tasks as MDPs in order to solve them by RL. The relevance of the action or state representation is critical for the agent to learn efficiently. Considering that the agent starts with a low level, task-agnostic state and action spaces based on its low-level perception and action capabilities, we describe open-ended learning as the challenge of building the adequate representation of states and actions, i.e., of redescribing available representations. We suggest an iterative approach to this problem based on several successive Representational Redescription processes, and highlight the corresponding challenges in which intrinsic motivations play a key role.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01889947,"['0.info', '1.info.info-rb']","['Reinforcement learning' 'Markov Decision Processes'

In an unbounded behavior space, it has already been shown that evolvable individuals naturally appear and tend to be selected as they are more likely to invade empty behavior niches. Evolvability is thus a natural byproduct of the search in this context. However, practical agents and environments often impose limits on the reach-able behavior space.

A meta-scheduler allocates a global computational budget by alternating between the two processes, ensuring the discovery and efficient exploitation of disjoint reward areas.

Method: Between 1977 and 2013, we searched several databases using the following key-words: « synchrony » « interaction » and « mother-child ». We focused on studies examining parent-child interactions among children aged 2 months to 5 years. From the 63 relevant studies, we extracted study description variables (authors, year, design, number of subjects, age); assessment conditions and modalities; and main findings. Results: The most common terms referring to synchrony were mutuality, reciprocity, rhythmicity, harmonious interaction, turn-taking and shared affect; all terms were used to characterize the mother-child dyad. As a consequence, we propose defining synchrony as a dynamic and reciprocal adaptation of the temporal structure of behaviors and shared affect between interactive partners. Three main types of assessment methods for studying synchrony emerged: (1) global interaction scales with dyadic items; (2) specific synchrony scales; and (3) micro-coded time-series analyses. It appears that synchrony should be regarded as a social signal per se as it has been shown to be valid in both normal and pathological populations. Better mother-child synchrony is associated with familiarity (vs. unknown partner), a healthy mother (vs. pathological mother), typical development (vs. psychopathological development), and a more positive child outcomes. Discussion: Synchrony is a key feature of mother-infant interactions. Adopting an objective approach in studying synchrony is not a simple task given available assessment tools and due to its temporality and multimodal expression. We propose an integrative approach combining clinical observation and engineering techniques to improve the quality of synchrony analysis.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01366294,"['0.shs', '1.shs.psy', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.mhep', '2.sdv.mhep.ped']","['mother-child interaction' 'synchrony' 'mother' 'child' 'interaction'

First, to robustly capture the local geometric properties of the surface, i.e., each point is characterized by all the triangles formed by itself and its nearest neighbours in the 3D point cloud. The idea is to assist the learning of the descriptor by introducing a priori information about interesting geometric properties such as the invariance of triangle angles under rigid transformations. This local triangle-based descriptor is integrated into the recently developed RoCNet architecture for estimating the correspondences between source and target point clouds. We then introduce the Farthest Sampling-guided Registration (FSR), which relies on successive farthest point samplings to estimate the global rigid transformation between 3D point clouds. The new proposed architecture RoCNet++ has been evaluated in different configurations: clean, noisy and partial data on both synthetic and real databases such as ModelNet40, KITTI, and 3DMatch.

While one hand holds the device, the other hand performs mid-air gestures in proximity of the device to control 3D objects on the mobile device's screen. A flat hand pose defines a virtual surface which we refer to as the PalmSpace for precise and intuitive 3D rotations. We constructed several hardware prototypes to test our interface and to simulate possible future mobile devices equipped with depth cameras. We conducted a user study to compare 3D rotation tasks using the most promising two designs for the hand location during interaction-behind and beside the device-with the virtual trackball, which is the current state-of-art technique for orientation manipulation on touch-screens.

Using the model without training (zero-shot) is another option that however suffers an effectiveness cost, especially in the case of first-stage retrievers. Numerous research directions have emerged to tackle these issues, most of them in the context of adapting to a task or a language. However, the literature is scarcer for domain (or topic) adaptation. In this paper, we address this issue of cross-topic discrepancy for a sparse first-stage retriever by transposing a method initially designed for language adaptation. By leveraging pre-training on the target data to learn domain-specific knowledge, this technique alleviates the need for annotated data and expands the scope of domain adaptation.

Consequently, AI has also been applied across most obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) domains, including general obstetrics, gynecology surgery, fetal ultrasound, and assisted reproductive medicine, among others. Objective The aim of this study was to provide a systematic review to establish the actual contributions of AI reported in OB/GYN discipline journals. Methods The PubMed database was searched for citations indexed with “artificial intelligence” and at least one of the following medical subject heading (MeSH) terms between January 1, 2000, and April 30, 2020: “obstetrics”; “gynecology”; “reproductive techniques, assisted”; or “pregnancy.” All publications in OB/GYN core disciplines journals were considered. The selection of journals was based on disciplines defined in Web of Science. The publications were excluded if no AI process was used in the study. Review, editorial, and commentary articles were also excluded. The study analysis comprised (1) classification of publications into OB/GYN domains, (2) description of AI methods, (3) description of AI algorithms, (4) description of data sets, (5) description of AI contributions, and (6) description of the validation of the AI process. Results The PubMed search retrieved 579 citations and 66 publications met the selection criteria. All OB/GYN subdomains were covered: obstetrics (41%, 27/66), gynecology (3%, 2/66), assisted reproductive medicine (33%, 22/66), early pregnancy (2%, 1/66), and fetal medicine (21%, 14/66). Both machine learning methods (39/66) and knowledge base methods (25/66) were represented. Machine learning used imaging, numerical, and clinical data sets. Knowledge base methods used mostly omics data sets. The actual contributions of AI were method/algorithm development (53%, 35/66), hypothesis generation (42%, 28/66), or software development (3%, 2/66). Validation was performed on one data set (86%, 57/66) and no external validation was reported. We observed a general rising trend in publications related to AI in OB/GYN over the last two decades. Most of these publications (82%, 54/66) remain out of the scope of the usual OB/GYN journals. Conclusions In OB/GYN discipline journals, mostly preliminary work (eg, proof-of-concept algorithm or method) in AI applied to this discipline is reported and clinical validation remains an unmet prerequisite.

We extend these lines of argument to propose an alternative taxonomy for spatial navigation, showing how various previously identified strategies can be distinguished as "" model-based "" or "" model-free "" depending on the usage of information and not on the type of information (e.g., cue vs. place). We argue that identifying "" model-free "" learning with dorsolateral striatum and "" model-based "" learning with dorsomedial striatum could reconcile numerous conflicting results in the spatial navigation literature. From this perspective, we further propose that the ventral striatum plays key roles in the model-building process. We propose that the core of the ventral striatum is positioned to learn the probability of action selection for every transition between states of the world. We further review suggestions that the ventral striatal core and shell are positioned to act as "" critics "" contributing to the computation of a reward prediction error for model-free and model-based systems, respectively.']",https://hal.science/hal-01219958,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.neu']","['spatial navigation' 'model-based' 'model-free' 'learning'

The current research attempts to determine if a neurophysiologically motivated model of cortical function in the primate can help to address this challenge. Primates are endowed with cognitive systems that allow them to maximize the feedback from their environment by learning the values of actions in diverse situations and by adjusting their behavioral parameters (i.e. cognitive control) to accommodate unexpected events. In such contexts uncertainty can arise from at least two distinct sources - expected uncertainty resulting from noise during sensory-motor interaction in a known context, and unexpected uncertainty resulting from the changing probabilistic structure of the environment. However, it is not clear how neurophysiological mechanisms of reinforcement learning and cognitive control integrate in the brain to produce efficient behavior. Based on primate neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, we propose a novel computational model for the interaction between lateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (LPFC and ACC) reconciling previous models dedicated to these two functions. We deployed the model in two robots and demonstrate that, based on adaptive regulation of a meta-parameter β that controls the exploration rate, the model can robustly deal with the two kinds of uncertainties in the real world. In addition the model could reproduce monkey behavioral performance and neurophysiological data in two problem-solving tasks. A last experiment extends this to human-robot interaction with the iCub humanoid, and novel sources of uncertainty corresponding to ""cheating"" by the human.

To better elucidate the computations underlying flexible behavior, we develop a dual-system computational model that can predict both performance (i.e., participants' choices) and modulations in reaction times during learning of a stimulus–response association task. The habitual system is modeled with a simple Q-Learning algorithm (QL). For the goal-directed system, we propose a new Bayesian Working Memory (BWM) model that searches for information in the history of previous trials in order to minimize Shannon entropy. We propose a model for QL and BWM coordination such that the expensive memory manipulation is under control of, among others, the level of convergence of the habitual learning. We test the ability of QL or BWM alone to explain human behavior, and compare them with the performance of model combinations, to highlight the need for such combinations to explain behavior.

Literature searches were conducted in the main scientific databases and 60 articles measuring the mental workload induced by the use of a wearable assistive device were included in this study.

In this work, we consider 12 coordination metrics identified from the literature and apply them to a simulated dataset based on reaching movements using two degrees of freedom. Each metric is evaluated according to eight criteria based on current understanding of human motor control physiology, i.e, each metric is graded on how well it fulfills each of these criteria. This comparative analysis highlights that no single inter-joint coordination metric can be considered as ideal. Depending on the movement characteristics that one seeks to understand, one or several metrics among those reviewed here may be pertinent in data analysis. We propose four main factors when choosing a metric (or a group of metrics): the importance of temporal vs. spatial coordination, the need for result explainability, the size of the dataset, and the computational resources.

We demonstrate experimentally that an a priori minor difference in the mechanical design of the robots leads to major differences in their collective behavior when they evolve in crowded environments. We design Morphobots, which are Kilobots augmented with a 3D-printed exoskeleton. The exoskeleton not only significantly improves the motility and stability of the Kilobots, it also allows to encode two contrasting dynamical behaviors in response to an external force or a collision. This difference translates into distinct performances at the individual and collective behaviour. These include response to an external force, interaction with a stationary wall, alignment with a movable obstacle, stabilization on a dynamically tilting plane, and self-organized aggregation when addressing a phototactic task. Enabling collisions also fluidizes the ensemble allowing the implementation of a decentralized on-line evolutionary reinforcement learning algorithm in a swarm of Morphobots.

In the southern part of the basin, a water mass characterised by low oxygen, high nutrient and low CFC concentrations occurs along the African continental slope. This water has been identified as the modified Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). It has been previously observed south of this section, at the latitude of the Canary Islands, as a northward flow between the African shelf and the islands.

D816V KIT mutation is associated with various pathologies including mastocytosis and cancers. D816V-mutated KIT is constitutively active, and resistant to treatment with the anti-cancer drug Imatinib. To elucidate the activating molecular mechanism of this mutation, we applied a multi-approach procedure combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, normal modes analysis (NMA) and binding site prediction. Multiple 50-ns MD simulations of wild-type KIT and its mutant D816V were recorded using the inactive auto-inhibited structure of the protein, characteristic of type III RTKs. Computed free energy differences enabled us to quantify the impact of D816V on protein stability in the inactive state. We evidenced a local structural alteration of the activation loop (A-loop) upon mutation, and a long-range structural re-organization of the juxta-membrane region (JMR) followed by a weakening of the interaction network with the kinase domain. A thorough normal mode analysis of several MD conformations led to a plausible molecular rationale to propose that JMR is able to depart its auto-inhibitory position more easily in the mutant than in wild-type KIT and is thus able to promote kinase mutant dimerization without the need for extra-cellular ligand binding. Pocket detection at the surface of NMA-displaced conformations finally revealed that detachment of JMR from the kinase domain in the mutant was sufficient to open an access to the catalytic and substrate binding sites.']",https://hal.science/hal-01505755,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.bm', '0.info', '1.info.info-bi']","['RTK' 'KIT' 'phosphorylation' 'conformation' 'mutation' 'mastocytosis'

Such an event can be described in terms of a large scale transmission of information (communication) through a dynamic coupling between structurally rigid (minimally frustrated) and plastic (locally frustrated) clusters of residues. To elaborate a rational description of allosteric coupling, we propose an original approach - MOdular NETwork Analysis (MONETA) - based on the analysis of inter-residue dynamical correlations to localize the propagation of both structural and dynamical effects of a perturbation throughout a protein structure. MONETA uses inter-residue cross-correlations and commute times computed from molecular dynamics simulations and a topological description of a protein to build a modular network representation composed of clusters of residues (dynamic segments) linked together by chains of residues (communication pathways). MONETA provides a brand new direct and simple visualization of protein allosteric communication. A GEPHI module implemented in the MONETA package allows the generation of 2D graphs of the communication network. An interactive PyMOL plugin permits drawing of the communication pathways between chosen protein fragments or residues on a 3D representation. MONETA is a powerful tool for on-the-fly display of communication networks in proteins. We applied MONETA for the analysis of communication pathways (i) between the main regulatory fragments of receptors tyrosine kinases (RTKs), KIT and CSF-1R, in the native and mutated states and (ii) in proteins STAT5 (STAT5a and STAT5b) in the phosphorylated and the unphosphorylated forms. The description of the physical support for allosteric coupling by MONETA allowed a comparison of the mechanisms of (a) constitutive activation induced by equivalent mutations in two RTKs and (b) allosteric regulation in the activated and non-activated STAT5 proteins. Our theoretical prediction based on results obtained with MONETA was validated for KIT by in vitro experiments.

Characterising protein conformational dynamics is increasingly recognised as necessary to understand how proteins function. Given a conformational ensemble, computational tools are needed to extract in a systematic way pertinent and comprehensive biological information. Results: Here, we present a method, Communication Mapping (COMMA), to decipher the dynamical architecture of a protein. The method first extracts residue-based dynamic properties from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Then, it integrates them in a graph theoretic framework, where it identifies groups of residues or protein regions that mediate short-and long-range communication. COMMA introduces original concepts to contrast the different roles played by these regions, namely communication blocks and communicating segment pairs, and evaluates the connections and communication strengths between them. We show the utility and capabilities of COMMA by applying it to three archetypal proteins, namely protein A, the tyrosine kinase KIT and the tumour suppressor p53. Conclusion: Our method permits to compare in a direct way the dynamical behaviour either of proteins with different characteristics or of the same protein in different conditions. It is useful to identify residues playing a key role in protein allosteric regulation and to explain the effects of deleterious mutations in a mechanistic way.

We show that sociability is an important factor and that the normalization permits to reach a much higher discriminative power than shape complementarity docking scores. The social effect is also observed with more sophisticated docking algorithms. Docking conformations are evaluated using experimental binding sites. These latter approximate in the best possible way binding sites predictions, which have reached high accuracy in recent years.

These contacts guided structural assembly of the domains using MAGMA, an advanced molecular dynamics docking method. The active conformation structure generated by MAGMA simultaneously accommodated the sequence derived residue contacts and the ATP-catalytic histidine contact. The validity of this structure was confirmed biologically by mutation of contact positions in the Bacillus subtilis sensor histidine kinase KinA and by restoration of activity in an inactive KinA(HisKA): KinD(HATPase) hybrid protein. These data indicate that signals binding to sensor domains activate sensor histidine kinases by causing localized strain and unwinding at the end of the C-terminal helix of the HisKA domain.

For example, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method has been successfully applied. Here, we test another possible inversion method: artificial neural networks (ANNs). We produce a training set that consists of 70 individual samples. Each sample is made of the 21\xa0cm power spectrum at different redshifts produced with the 21cmFast code plus the value of three parameters used in the seminumerical simulations that describe astrophysical processes.

We explore the impact of the architecture of the network on the quality of the training. Then we test the trained network on the new set of 54 test samples with different values of the parameters. We find that the quality of the parameter reconstruction depends on the sensitivity of the power spectrum to the different parameters at a given redshift, that including thermal noise and sample variance decreases the quality of the reconstruction and that using the power spectrum at several redshifts as an input to the ANN improves the quality of the reconstruction.

The bar in the thin disc component is ~50% stronger than the thick disc bar and is more elongated, with an axis ratio almost half that of the thick disc bar. The thin disc b/p bulge has a pronounced X-shape, while the thick disc b/p is weaker with a rather boxy shape. This leads to the signature of the b/p bulge in the thick disc being weaker and further away from the plane than in the thin disc. Regarding the kinematics, we find that the los velocity of thick disc stars in the outer parts of the b/p bulge can be higher than that of thin disc stars, by up to 40% and 20% for side-on and Milky Way-like orientations of the bar, respectively. This is due to the different orbits followed by thin and thick disc stars in the bar-b/p region, which are affected by two factors. First, thin disc stars are trapped more efficiently in the bar-b/p instability and thus lose more angular momentum than their thick disc counterparts and second, thick disc stars have large radial excursions and therefore stars from large radii with high angular momenta can be found in the bar region. We also find that the difference between the los velocities of the thin and thick disc in the b/p bulge (Δvlos) correlates with the initial difference between the radial velocity dispersions of the two discs (Δσ).

Because of the mixing time scales in the inner Galaxy, it has been claimed that these streams should be difficult to detect in configuration space but can still be identifiable in kinematic-related spaces like the energy/angular momenta spaces, E − Lz and L⊥ − Lz, or spaces of orbital/velocity parameters. By means of high-resolution, dissipationless N-body simulations containing between 25 × 106 and 35 × 106 particles, we model the accretion of a series of up to four 1:10 mass ratio satellites then up to eight 1:100 satellites and search systematically for the signature of accretions in these spaces. The novelty of this work with respect to the majority of those already published is our analysis of fully consistent models, where both the satellite(s) and the Milky Way galaxy are “live” systems, which can react to the interaction and experience kinematical heating, tidal effects and dynamical friction (the latter, a process often neglected in previous studies). We find that, in agreement with previous works, all spaces are rich in substructures, but that, contrary to previous works, the origin of these substructures – accreted or in-situ – cannot be determined for the following reasons. In all spaces considered (1) each satellite provides the origin of several independent over-densities; (2) over-densities of multiple satellites overlap; (3) satellites of different masses can produce similar substructures; (4) the overlap between the in-situ and the accreted population is considerable everywhere; and (5) in-situ stars also form substructures in response to the satellite(s’) accretion. These points are valid even if the search is restricted to kinematically-selected halo stars only. As we are now entering the “Gaia era”, our results warn that extreme caution must be employed before interpreting over-densities in any of those spaces as evidence of relics of accreted satellites. Reconstructing the accretion history of our Galaxy will require a substantial amount of accurate spectroscopic data, that, complemented by the kinematic information, will possibly allow us to (chemically) identify accreted streams and measure their orbital properties.']",https://hal.science/hal-02191657,"['0.phys', '1.phys.astr']","['Galaxy' 'satellites' 'accretion' 'Milky Way' 'cosmological' 'streams'

Molecular lines and line ratios are commonly used to infer properties of extra-galactic star forming regions. The new generation of millimeter receivers almost turns every observation into a line survey. Full exploitation of this technical advancement in extra-galactic study requires detailed bench-marking of available line diagnostics.Aims. We aim to develop the Orion\u2009B giant molecular cloud (GMC) as a local template for interpreting extra-galactic molecular line observations.Methods. We use the wide-band receiver at the IRAM-30\u2009m to spatially and spectrally resolve the Orion\u2009B GMC. The observations cover almost 1 square degree at 26′′ resolution with a bandwidth of 32 GHz from 84 to 116 GHz in only two tunings. Among the mapped spectral lines are the 12CO, 13CO, C18O, C17O, HCN, HNC, 12CN, C2H, HCO+, N2H+(1−0), and 12CS, 32SO, SiO, c - C3H2, CH3OH (2−1) transitions.Results. We introduce the molecular anatomy of the Orion\u2009B GMC, including relationships between line intensities and gas column density or far-UV radiation fields, and correlations between selected line and line ratios. We also obtain a dust-traced gas mass that is less than approximately one third the CO-traced mass, using the standard XCO conversion factor. The presence of over-luminous CO can be traced back to the dependence of the CO intensity on UV illumination. As a matter of fact, while most lines show some dependence on the UV radiation field, CN and C2H are the most sensitive. Moreover, dense cloud cores are almost exclusively traced by N2H+. Other traditional high-density tracers, such as HCN(1−0), are also easily detected in extended translucent regions at a typical density of ~500\u2009H2 cm-3. In general, we find no straightforward relationship between line critical density and the fraction of the line luminosity coming from dense gas regions.Conclusions. Our initial findings demonstrate that the relationships between line (ratio) intensities and environment in GMCs are more complicated than often assumed. Sensitivity (i.e., the molecular column density), excitation, and, above all, chemistry contribute to the observed line intensity distributions, and they must be considered together when developing the next generation of extra-galactic molecular line diagnostics of mass, density, temperature, and radiation field.']",https://hal.science/hal-01400616,"['0.phys', '1.phys.astr', '0.phys', '0.phys', '1.phys.astr']","['star forming regions' 'molecular lines' 'millimeter receivers'

We try to observationally derive the fractions of momentum density ($\\rho v$) contained in the solenoidal and compressive modes of turbulence in the Orion B molecular cloud and relate these fractions to the star formation efficiency in the cloud. The implementation of a statistical method developed by Brunt & Federrath (2014), applied to a $^{13}$CO(J=1-0) datacube obtained with the IRAM-30m telescope, allows us to retrieve 3-dimensional quantities from the projected quantities provided by the observations, yielding an estimate of the compressive versus solenoidal ratio in various regions of the cloud. Despite the Orion B molecular cloud being highly supersonic (mean Mach number $\\sim$ 6), the fractions of motion in each mode diverge significantly from equipartition. The cloud's motions are on average mostly solenoidal (excess > 8 % with respect to equipartition), which is consistent with its low star formation rate. On the other hand, the motions around the main star-forming regions (NGC 2023 and NGC 2024) prove to be strongly compressive. We have successfully applied to observational data a method that was so far only tested on simulations, and have shown that there can be a strong intra-cloud variability of the compressive and solenoidal fractions, these fractions being in turn related to the star formation efficiency.

Filaments are a key step on the path that leads from molecular clouds to star formation. However, their characteristics, for instance their width, are heavily debated and the exact processes that lead to their formation and fragmentation into dense cores still remain to be fully understood.Aims. We aim at characterising the mass, kinematics, and stability against gravitational collapse of a statistically significant sample of filaments in the Orion B molecular cloud, which is renown for its very low star formation efficiency.Methods. We characterised the gas column densities and kinematics over a field of 1.9 deg2, using C18O (J = 1−0) data from the IRAM 30 m large programme ORION-B at angular and spectral resolutions of 23.5″ and 49.5 kHz, respectively. Using two different Hessian-based filters, we extracted and compared two filamentary networks, each containing over 100 filaments.Results. Independent of the extraction method, the filament networks have consistent characteristics. The filaments have widths of ~0.12 ± 0.04 pc and show a wide range of linear (~1−100\xa0M⊙ pc−1) and volume densities (~2 × 103−2 × 105 cm−3). Compared to previous studies, the filament population is dominated by low-density, thermally sub-critical structures, suggesting that most of the identified filaments are not collapsing to form stars. In fact, only ~1% of the Orion B cloud mass covered by our observations can be found in super-critical, star-forming filaments, explaining the low star formation efficiency of the region. The velocity profiles observed across the filaments show quiescence in the centre and coherency in the plane of the sky, even though these profiles are mostly supersonic.Conclusions. The filaments in Orion B apparently belong to a continuum which contains a few elements comparable to already studied star-forming filaments, for example in the IC 5146, Aquila or Taurus regions, as well as many lower density, gravitationally unbound structures. This comprehensive study of the Orion B filaments shows that the mass fraction in super-critical filaments is a key factor in determining star formation efficiency.']",https://hal.science/hal-02013389,"['0.phys', '1.phys.astr']","['filaments' 'star formation' 'molecular clouds' 'Orion B' 'gravity'

These cubes contain much information on the physical, chemical, and kinematical properties of the emitting gas. However, their large size coupled with inhomogenous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are major challenges for consistent analysis and interpretation. We search for a denoising method of the low SNR regions of the studied data cubes that would allow to recover the low SNR emission without distorting the signals with high SNR. We perform an in-depth data analysis of the 13 CO and C 17 O (1 − 0) data cubes obtained as part of the ORION-B large program performed at the IRAM 30m telescope. We analyse the statistical properties of the noise and the evolution of the correlation of the signal in a given frequency channel with that of the adjacent channels. This allows us to propose significant improvements of typical autoassociative neural networks, often used to denoise hyperspectral Earth remote sensing data. Applying this method to the 13 CO (1 − 0) cube, we compare the denoised data with those derived with the multiple Gaussian fitting algorithm ROHSA, considered as the state of the art procedure for data line cubes. The nature of astronomical spectral data cubes is distinct from that of the hyperspectral data usually studied in the Earth remote sensing literature because the observed intensities become statistically independent beyond a short channel separation. This lack of redundancy in data has led us to adapt the method, notably by taking into account the sparsity of the signal along the spectral axis. The application of the proposed algorithm leads to an increase of the SNR in voxels with weak signal, while preserving the spectral shape of the data in high SNR voxels. The proposed algorithm that combines a detailed analysis of the noise statistics with an innovative autoencoder architecture is a promising path to denoise radio-astronomy line data cubes.']",https://hal.science/hal-04167877v2,"['0.phys', '1.phys.astr', '2.phys.astr.co']","['Millimeter radio telescopes' 'Position-position-frequency data cubes'

Previous attempts at segmenting molecular line maps of molecular clouds have focused on using position-position-velocity data cubes of a single molecular line to separate the spatial components of the cloud. In contrast, wide field spectral imaging over a large spectral bandwidth in the (sub)mm domain now allows one to combine multiple molecular tracers to understand the different physical and chemical phases that constitute giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Aims. We aim at using multiple tracers (sensitive to different physical processes and conditions) to segment a molecular cloud into physically/chemically similar regions (rather than spatially connected components), thus disentangling the different physical/chemical phases present in the cloud. Methods. We use a machine learning clustering method, namely the Meanshift algorithm, to cluster pixels with similar molecular emission, ignoring spatial information. Clusters are defined around each maximum of the multidimensional probability density function (PDF) of the line integrated intensities. Simple radiative transfer models were used to interpret the astrophysical informationuncovered by the clustering analysis. Results. A clustering analysis based only on the $J$ = 1–0 lines of three isotopologues of CO proves sufficient to reveal distinct density/column density regimes ($n_H$ ∼ 100 cm$^{−3}$, ∼500 cm$^{−3}$, and >1000 cm$^{−3}$), closely related to the usual definitions of diffuse, translucent and high-column-density regions. Adding two UV-sensitive tracers, the $J$ = 1–0 line of HCO$^+$ and the $N$ = 1–0 line of CN, allows us to distinguish two clearly distinct chemical regimes, characteristic of UV-illuminated and UV-shielded gas. The UV-illuminated regime shows overbright HCO$^+$ and CN emission, which we relate to a photochemical enrichment effect. We also find a tail of high CN/HCO$^+$ intensity ratio in UV-illuminated regions. Finer distinctions in density classes ($n_H$ ∼ 7 × 10$^3$ cm$^{−3}$ , ∼4 × 10$^4$ cm$^{−3}$) for the densest regions are also identified, likely related to the higher critical density of the CN and HCO$^+$ (1–0) lines. These distinctions are only possible because the high-density regions are spatially resolved. Conclusions. Molecules are versatile tracers of GMCs because their line intensities bear the signature of the physics and chemistry at play in the gas. The association of simultaneous multi-line, wide-field mapping and powerful machine learning methods such as the Meanshift clustering algorithm reveals how to decode the complex information available in these molecular tracers.']",https://hal.science/hal-01621390,"['0.sdu', '1.sdu.astr', '2.sdu.astr.ga']","['Clouds' 'Molecular' 'Line maps' 'Spectral imaging' 'Wide field'

From an observational point of view, the feedback from young high-mass stars on future star formation properties is still poorly constrained.

We used the ROHSA algorithm to decompose and de-noise the C18O(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) signals by taking the spatial coherence of the emission into account. We produced gas column density and mean velocity maps to estimate the relative orientation of their spatial gradients. We identified three cloud velocity layers at different systemic velocities and extracted the filaments in each velocity layer. The filaments are preferentially located in regions of low centroid velocity gradients. By comparing the relative orientation between the column density and velocity gradients of each layer from the ORION-B observations and synthetic observations from 3D kinematic toy models, we distinguish two types of behavior in the dynamics around filaments: (i) radial flows perpendicular to the filament axis that can be either inflows (increasing the filament mass) or outflows and (ii) longitudinal flows along the filament axis. The former case is seen in the Orion B data, while the latter is not identified. We have also identified asymmetrical flow patterns, usually associated with filaments located at the edge of an HII region. This is the first observational study to highlight feedback from HII regions on filament formation and, thus, on star formation in the Orion B cloud.

With baselines of up to ~2000 km, LOFAR has the unique capability of achieving sub-arcsecond resolution at frequencies below 200 MHz. However, it is technically and logistically challenging to process LOFAR data at this resolution. To date only a handful of publications have exploited this capability. Here we present a calibration strategy that builds on previous high-resolution work with LOFAR. It is implemented in a pipeline using mostly dedicated LOFAR software tools and the same processing framework as the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). We give an overview of the calibration strategy and discuss the special challenges inherent to enacting high-resolution imaging with LOFAR, and describe the pipeline, which is publicly available, in detail. We demonstrate the calibration strategy by using the pipeline on P205+55, a typical LoTSS pointing with an 8 h observation and 13 international stations. We perform in-field delay calibration, solution referencing to other calibrators in the field, self-calibration of these calibrators, and imaging of example directions of interest in the field. We find that for this specific field and these ionospheric conditions, dispersive delay solutions can be transferred between calibrators up to ~1.5° away, while phase solution transferral works well over ~1°. We also demonstrate a check of the astrometry and flux density scale with the in-field delay calibrator source. Imaging in 17 directions, we find the restoring beam is typically ~0.3'' ×0.2'' although this varies slightly over the entire 5 deg<SUP>2</SUP> field of view. We find we can achieve ~80-300 μJy bm<SUP>−1</SUP> image rms noise, which is dependent on the distance from the phase centre; typical values are ~90 μJy bm<SUP>−1</SUP> for the 8 h observation with 48 MHz of bandwidth. Seventy percent of processed sources are detected, and from this we estimate that we should be able to image roughly 900 sources per LoTSS pointing. This equates to ~ 3 million sources in the northern sky, which LoTSS will entirely cover in the next several years. Future optimisation of the calibration strategy for efficient post-processing of LoTSS at high resolution makes this estimate a lower limit.""]",https://insu.hal.science/insu-03611703,"['0.sdu', '0.sdu', '1.sdu.astr']","['LOFAR' 'Telescope' 'Interferometer' 'Calibration' 'Strategy' 'Pipeline'

Establishing the precise diagnosis of pregnancy location is key for appropriate management of early pregnancies, and experts are usually able to locate a pregnancy in the first scan. A decision-support system based on a semantic, expert-validated knowledge base may improve the diagnostic performance of nonexpert examiners for early pregnancy transvaginal ultrasound. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate a novel Intelligent Scan Assistant System for early pregnancy ultrasound to diagnose the pregnancy location and determine the image quality. METHODS: Two trainees performed virtual transvaginal ultrasound examinations of early pregnancy cases with and without the system. The ultrasound images and reports were blindly reviewed by two experts using scoring methods. A diagnosis of pregnancy location and ultrasound image quality were compared between scans performed with and without the system. RESULTS: Each trainee performed a virtual vaginal examination for all 32 cases with and without use of the system. The analysis of the 128 resulting scans showed higher quality of the images (quality score: +23%; P<.001), less images per scan (4.6 vs 6.3 [without the CDSS]; P<.001), and higher confidence in reporting conclusions (trust score: +20%; P<.001) with use of the system. Further, use of the system cost an additional 8 minutes per scan. We observed a correct diagnosis of pregnancy location in 39 (61%) and 52 (81%) of 64 scans in the nonassisted mode and assisted mode, respectively. Additionally, an exact diagnosis (with precise ectopic location) was made in 30 (47%) and 49 (73%) of the 64 scans without and with use of the system, respectively. These differences in diagnostic performance (+20% for correct location diagnosis and +30% for exact diagnosis) were both statistically significant (P=.002 and P<.001, respectively).

The positive diagnosis of this condition is established through transvaginal ultrasound scanning. The timing of diagnosis depends on the operator expertise in identifying the signs of ectopic pregnancy, which varies dramatically among medical staff with heterogeneous training. Developing decision support systems in this context is expected to improve the identification of these signs and subsequently improve the quality of care. In this article, we present a new knowledge base for ectopic pregnancy, and we demonstrate its use on the annotation of clinical images.ResultsThe knowledge base is supported by an application ontology, which provides the taxonomy, the vocabulary and definitions for 24 types and 81 signs of ectopic pregnancy, 484 anatomical structures and 32 technical elements for image acquisition. The knowledge base provides a sign-centric model of the domain, with the relations of signs to ectopic pregnancy types, anatomical structures and the technical elements. The evaluation of the ontology and knowledge base demonstrated a positive feedback from a panel of 17 medical users. Leveraging these semantic resources, we developed an application for the annotation of ultrasound images. Using this application, 6 operators achieved a precision of 0.83 for the identification of signs in 208 ultrasound images corresponding to 35 clinical cases of ectopic pregnancy.ConclusionsWe developed a new ectopic pregnancy knowledge base for the annotation of ultrasound images. The use of this knowledge base for the annotation of ultrasound images of ectopic pregnancy showed promising results from the perspective of clinical decision support system development.

In order to evaluate our system in French, we built a corpus for 5 types of clinical entities.METHODS:We used a terminology-based system as baseline, built upon UMLS and SNOMED. Then, we evaluated a biGRU-CRF, and a hybrid system using the prediction of the terminology-based system as feature for the biGRU-CRF. In French, we built APcNER, a corpus of 147 documents annotated for 5 entities (Drug names, Signs or symptoms, Diseases or disorders, Diagnostic procedures or lab tests and Therapeutic procedures). We evaluated each NER systems using exact and partial match definition of F-measure for NER. The APcNER contains 4,837 entities, which took 28 h to annotate. The inter-annotator agreement as measured by Cohen's Kappa was substantial for non-exact match (Κ = 0.61) and moderate considering exact match (Κ = 0.42). In English, we evaluated the NER systems on the i2b2-2009 Medication Challenge for Drug name recognition, which contained 8,573 entities for 268 documents, and i2b2-small a version reduced to match APcNER number of entities.RESULTS:For drug name recognition on both i2b2-2009 and APcNER, the biGRU-CRF performed better that the terminology-based system, with an exact-match F-measure of 91.1% versus 73% and 81.9% versus 75% respectively. For i2b2-small and APcNER, the hybrid system outperformed the biGRU-CRF, with an exact-match F-measure of 87.8% versus 85.6% and 86.4% versus 81.9% respectively.

Traditional approaches to this problem depend heavily on the coverage of available resources, which poses a problem for languages other than English. Objective: We present a system for concept normalization in French. We consider textual mentions already extracted and labeled by a named entity recognition system, and we classify these mentions with a UMLS concept unique identifier. We take advantage of the multilingual nature of available terminologies and embedding models to improve concept normalization in French without translation nor direct supervision. Materials and methods: We consider the task as a highly-multiclass classification problem. The terms are encoded with contextualized embeddings and classified via cosine similarity and softmax. A first step uses a subset of the terminology to finetune the embeddings and train the model. A second step adds the entire target terminology, and the model is trained further with hard negative selection and softmax sampling. Results: On two corpora from the Quaero FrenchMed benchmark, we show that our approach can lead to good results even with no labeled data at all; and that it outperforms existing supervised methods with labeled data. Discussion: Training the system with both French and English terms improves by a large margin the performance of the system on a French benchmark, regardless of the way the embeddings were pretrained (French, English, multilingual). Our distantly supervised method can be applied to any kind of documents or medical domain, as it does not require any concept-labeled documents.

CAP is considered a physiological marker of sleep instability. Despite its informative nature, the clinical applications remain limited as CAP analysis is a time-consuming activity. In order to overcome this limit, several automatic detection methods were recently developed. In this paper, two new dimensions were investigated in the attempt to optimize novel, efficient and automatic detection algorithms: 1) many electroencephalographic leads were compared to identify the best local performance, and 2) the global contribution of the concurrent detection across several derivations to CAP identification. The developed algorithms were tested on 41 polysomnographic recordings from normal (n = 8) and pathological (n = 33) subjects. In comparison with the visual CAP analysis as the gold standard, the performance of each algorithm was evaluated. Locally, the detection on the F4-C4 derivation showed the best performance in comparison with all other leads, providing practical suggestions of electrode montage when a lean and minimally invasive approach is preferable. A further improvement in the detection was achieved by a multi-trace method, the Global Analysis-Common Events, to be applied when several recording derivations are available. Moreover, CAP time and CAP rate obtained with these algorithms positively correlated with the ones identified by the scorer. These preliminary findings support efficient automated ways for the evaluation of the sleep instability, generalizable to both normal and pathological subjects affected by different sleep disorders.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-03464976,['0.info'],"['CAP' 'sleep' 'electroencephalography' 'sleep instability'

Nevertheless, in most of the European countries videocapsules are not yet considered as a systematic valid alternative to classic endoscopies and colonoscopies. Main reasons are in the existing technological limitations of videocapsules that are of two kinds: (i) A limited battery life-time (8 hours usually ensured by the manufacturer) that does not allow a complete imaging of the gastro intestinal tract, and (ii) the limited performance of the device in terms of detection rate of particular structures like polyps for instance which degenerations are at the origin of colorectal cancer. To overpass these limitations, main idea of our work is to develop a generation of smart videocapsules that takes advantage of the constant progress in electronics and most precisely in embedded signal processing tasks. In this Chapter, we give first a detailed overview of the most recent state-of-the-art related to videocapsules from the technological perspective in order to clearly positioned our work among the existing products and on going projects. In a second time, we propose a synthetic recall of the Cyclope project in the framework of which we are studying different strategies to improve the performance of current videocapsules in the particular context of the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer (polyp detection). We then propose a particular focus on the design optimization of the proposed algorithms from an electronic perspective. Most precisely, we give concrete elements and quantitative estimation (time processing, embedding performance, etc.) to show that embedding of the signal processing IP inside the videocapsule is feasible considering the most recent FPGA-platform performance, and that such an integration can bring a positive balance in terms of energy consumption by drastically reducing the amount of transmitted data.']",https://hal.science/hal-01150094,"['0.info', '1.info.info-ti', '0.spi', '1.spi.signal', '0.spi', '0.spi', '1.spi.tron']","['wireless videocapsule' 'gastrointestinal pathologies'

In the next step, we investigate the verification of real time properties over ITA. We prove that model checking SCL, a fragment of a timed linear time logic, is undecidable. On the other hand, we give model checking procedures for two fragments of timed branching time logic. We also compare the expressive power of classical timed automata and ITA and prove that the corresponding families of accepted languages are incomparable. The result also holds for languages accepted by controlled real-time automata (CRTA), that extend timed automata.

A new embed- dable method for polyp detection in wireless capsule endoscopic images was developed and tested. Methods: First, possible polyps within the image were extracted using geometric shape features. Next, the candidate regions of interest were evaluated with a boosting-based method using textural features. Each step was carefully chosen to accommodate hard- ware implementation constraints. The method's performance was evaluated on WCE datasets including 300 images with polyps and 1200 images without polyps. Hardware implementation of the proposed approach was evaluated to quantitatively demonstrate the feasibility of such integration into the WCE itself. Results: The boosting-based polyp classi cation demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.0%, a speci city of 95.2% and a false detection rate of 4.8%. This performance is close to that reported recently in systems developed for an on-line analysis of video colonoscopy images. Conclusion: A new method for polyp detection in videoendoscopic WCE examinations was developed using boosting-based approach. This method achieved good classi ca- tion performance and can be implemented in situ with embedded hardware.""]",https://hal.science/hal-00843459,"['0.spi', '1.spi.tron', '0.spi', '1.spi.signal', '0.info', '1.info.info-ts', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.ib', '0.info', '1.info.info-ti']","['Wireless capsule endoscopy' 'polyp detection' 'boosting-based method'

We describe the NoC architecture and the distributed mechanism of dynamic allocation. We study the feasibility of the NoC based on state of the art components and analyze its performances. Static analysis shows that, for point to point communications, its latency is comparable with a 256-node electrical mesh and becomes lower for wider networks. A major feature of this architecture is its broadcast capacity. The RF NoC becomes faster with 32 nodes, achieving a ×3 speedup with 1024.

We introduce the notion of increasing algorithm and a simple reduction that transforms any increasing algorithm into a truthful one.

According to this definition, analyzing the data by considering successive snapshots induces a significant loss of information: we suggest that it blurs essentially dynamic phenomena--such as communities based on repeated inter-temporal interactions, nodes switching from a community to another across time, or the possibility that a community survives while its members are being integrally replaced over a longer time period.

In this article, we develop a formal framework for the application of a large family of diversity measures to heterogeneous information networks (HINs), a flexible, widely-used network data formalism. This extends the application of diversity measures, from systems of classifications and apportionments, to more complex relations that can be better modeled by networks. In doing so, we not only provide an effective organization of multiple practices from different domains, but also unearth new observables in systems modeled by heterogeneous information networks. We illustrate the pertinence of our approach by developing different applications related to various domains concerned by both diversity and networks. In particular, we illustrate the usefulness of these new proposed observables in the domains of recommender systems and social media studies, among other fields.']",https://hal.science/hal-03608575,"['0.info', '0.info', '1.info.info-it']","['diversity' 'network analysis' 'information retrieval'

BIOASQ assesses the ability of systems to semantically index very large numbers of biomedical scientific articles, and to return concise and user-understandable answers to given natural language questions by combining information from biomedical articles and ontologies. Results : The 2013 BIOASQ competition comprised two tasks, Task 1a and Task 1b. In Task 1a participants were asked to automatically annotate new PUBMED documents with MESH headings. Twelve teams participated in Task 1a, with a total of 46 system runs submitted, and one of the teams performing consistently better than the MTI indexer used by NLM to suggest MESH headings to curators. Task 1b used benchmark datasets containing 29 development and 282 test English questions, along with gold standard (reference) answers, prepared by a team of biomedical experts from around Europe and participants had to automatically produce answers. Three teams participated in Task 1b, with 11 system runs. The BIOASQ infrastructure, including benchmark datasets, evaluation mechanisms, and the results of the participants and baseline methods, is publicly available. Conclusions : A publicly available evaluation infrastructure for biomedical semantic indexing and QA has been developed, which includes benchmark datasets, and can be used to evaluate systems that: assign MESH headings to published articles or to English questions; retrieve relevant RDF triples from ontologies, relevant articles and snippets from PUBMED Central; produce “exact” and paragraph-sized “ideal” answers (summaries). The results of the systems that participated in the 2013 BIOASQ competition are promising. In Task 1a one of the systems performed consistently better from the NLM’s MTI indexer. In Task 1b the systems received high scores in the manual evaluation of the “ideal” answers; hence, they produced high quality summaries as answers. Overall, BIOASQ helped obtain a unified view of how techniques from text classification, semantic indexing, document and passage retrieval, question answering, and text summarization can be combined to allow biomedical experts to obtain concise, user-understandable answers to questions reflecting their real information needs.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01156600,"['0.info', '1.info.info-bi']","['biomedical' 'semantic' 'indexing' 'question answering' 'competition'

Our long-term objectives are to help professors in categorizing those questions, and to provide students with feedback on the quality of their questions. To do so, we developed a coding scheme and then used it for automatic annotation of the whole corpus. We identified student characteristics from the typology of questions they asked using the k-means algorithm over four courses. Students were clustered based on question dimensions only. Then, we characterized the clusters by attributes not used for clustering, such as student grade, attendance, and number and popularity of questions asked.

This has prompted research on fairness metrics meant to capture and quantify such biases. Nonetheless, current metrics primarily focus on predictive performance comparisons between groups, without considering the behavior of the models or the severity of the biases in the outcomes. To address this gap, we proposed a novel metric in a previous work (Verger et al., 2023) named Model Absolute Density Distance (MADD), measuring algorithmic unfairness as the difference of the probability distributions of the model’s outcomes. In this paper, we extended our previous work with two major additions. Firstly, we provided theoretical and practical considerations on a hyperparameter of MADD, named bandwidth, useful for optimal measurement of fairness with this metric. Secondly, we demonstrated how MADD can be used not only to measure unfairness but also to mitigate it through postprocessing of the model’s outcomes while preserving its accuracy. We experimented with our approach on the same task of predicting student success in online courses as our previous work, and obtained successful results.

Consequently, we investigate the use of the recent virtual element method which appears as a potential discretization method for the mechanical part and could therefore allow the use of a unique mesh for the both mechanical and fluid flow modelling. Starting from a first insight into virtual element method applied to the elastic problem in the context of geomechanical simulations, we apply in addition a finite volume method to take care of the fluid conservation equation. We focus on the first order virtual element method and the two point flux approximation for the finite volume part.

We focus more specifically on dissolved Si (DSi), amorphous Si (ASi,) lithogenic Si (LSi), Particulate Organic Carbon (POC), Total Suspended Material (TSM), Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN), salinity and fucoxanthin, a marker pigment for diatoms. Overall, we show that the estuaries have strong inter and intra variability of their biogeochemical parameters both seasonally and along salinity gradients. Based on Principal Component Analysis and clustering of categorised (upper and lower) estuaries, we discuss the four major processes controlling the Si variability of Indian estuaries: 1) lithogenic supply, 2) diatom uptake, 3) mixing of sea water and, 4) land use. The influence of lithogenic control is significantly higher during the wet period than during the dry period, due to a higher particle supply through monsoonal discharge. A significant diatom uptake is only identified in the estuaries during dry period. By taking into account the non-conservative nature of Si and by extrapolating our results, we estimate the fluxes from the Indian subcontinent of DSi, ASi, LSi to the Bay of Bengal (211 ± 32, 10 ± 4.7, 2028 ± 317 Gmol) and Arabian Sea (80 ± 15, 7 ± 1.1, 1717 ± 932 Gmol). We show the impact of land use in watersheds with higher levels of agricultural activity amplifies the supply of Si to the coastal Bay of Bengal during the wet season. In contrast, forest cover and steep slopes cause less Si supply to the Arabian Sea by restricting erosion when entering the estuary. Finally, Si:N ratios show that nitrogen is always in deficit relative to silicon for diatom growth, these high Si:N ratios likely contribute to the prevention of eutrophication in the Indian estuaries and coastal sea.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01651900,"['0.sdu', '1.sdu.stu', '2.sdu.stu.oc', '0.sdu', '1.sdu.envi']","['Silicon' 'Biogeochemical' 'Cycle' 'Estuaries' 'India' 'Diatoms'

Sensitivity experiments have shown that taking SST into account significantly increases the accuracy of the high-resolution velocity retrieval, even when noise is added to the SSH data. The velocity information embedded in the transport equation modeling the SST advection is taken into account by the CNN, which greatly increases the resolution of ocean currents provided by SSH.

In the framework of the AMMA international Program, a transect of three ground based stations, the ""Sahelian Dust Transect"" (SDT), has been deployed in order to obtain quantitative information on the mineral dust content over the Sahel. These three stations: Banizoumbou (Niger), Cinzana (Mali) and M\'Bour (Senegal) are aligned at 13 degrees N along the east-west main pathway of the Saharan and Sahelian dust toward the Atlantic Ocean. The SDT provides a set of aerosol measurements and local meteorological parameters to describe and understand the mechanisms that control the temporal and regional variability of mineral dust content in these regions. In this work we analyze the seasonal and diurnal variability of the dust concentrations over the period 2006-2010. The analysis of the dust concentrations measured between 2006 and 2010 confirmed a regional seasonal cycle characterized by a maximum in the dry season, with median concentration ranging from 205 mu g m(-3) at Banizoumbou to 144 mu g m(-3) at M\'Bour, and a minimum (11-32 mu g m(-3)) in the wet season. The five year data set allowed the quantification of the variability of the monthly concentrations. The range between the percentiles 75 and 25 varies linearly with the median concentration: it is of the same order than the median value in M\'Bour, 17% slightly higher in Cinzana and 50% higher in Banizoumbou. The range between the accepted maximum and minimum is also correlated with the median value, with slopes ranging from 14 in Banizoumbou to 7 in M\'Bour. Part of the variability of the concentration at the monthly scale is due to interannual variability. Extremely high or low monthly concentration can be recorded that significantly impacts the five year median concentration and its range. Compared to the 3-year data set analyzed by Marticorena et al. (2010), the two additional years used in this work appear as the less dusty year (2009) and one of the dustier years (2010). The sampling time step and the high recovery rates of the measurement stations allowed to investigate the diurnal cycle of the dust concentration for the first time. During the dry season, the hourly median concentrations range from 80 to 100 mu g m(-3) during the night to 100-160 mu g m(-3) during the day-time maximum. The diurnal cycle of the PM10 concentrations is phased with the diurnal cycle of the surface wind speed and thus modulated by the interactions between the nocturnal lower level jet (NLLJ) and the surface boundary layer. The NUJ appears as a major agent to transport Saharan dust toward the Sahel. During the wet season, the median PM10 concentrations are maximum at night-time (<50 mu g m(-3)). The night-time concentrations are associated with a large range of variability and coincide with the periods of higher occurrence of meso-scale convective systems. The amplitude of the diurnal cycle is of the order of 60 mu g m(-3) in the dry season and 20 mu g m(-3) in the wet season. Both in the dry and in the wet season, despite a month to month variability of the daily dust concentration, a typical diurnal pattern has been established suggesting that this temporal pattern is mainly driven by local meteorological conditions.']",https://hal.science/hal-01496768,"['0.phys', '1.phys.phys', '2.phys.phys.phys-geo-ph']","['Mineral dust' 'Sahel' 'West Africa' 'Sahelian Dust Transect' 'Aerosol'

Most algorithms for host-parasite reconciliation use an event-based model, where the events include in general (a subset of) cospeciation, duplication, loss, and host-switch. All known parsimonious event-based methods then assign a cost to each type of event in order to find a reconstruction of minimum cost. The main problem with this approach is that the cost of the events strongly influences the reconciliation obtained.To deal with this problem, we developed an algorithm, called Coala, for estimating the frequency of the events based on an approximate Bayesian computation approach. The benefits of this method are twofold: (1) it provides more confidence in the set of costs to be used in a reconciliation, and (2) it allows estimation of the frequency of the events in cases where the dataset consists of trees with a large number of taxa.We evaluate our method on simulated and on biological datasets. We show that in both cases, for the same pair of host and parasite trees, different sets of frequencies for the events lead to equally probable solutions. Moreover, often these solutions differ greatly in terms of the number of inferred events. It appears crucial to take this into account before attempting any further biological interpretation of such reconciliations. More generally, we also show that the set of frequencies can vary widely depending on the input host and parasite trees.

To address this, we begin by presenting, within a unified framework, the various hypergraph modularity criteria proposed in the literature, emphasizing their differences and respective focuses. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art codes available to maximize hypergraph modularities for detecting node communities in binary hypergraphs. Through exploration of various simulation settings with controlled ground truth clustering, we offer a comparison of these methods using different quality measures, including true clustering recovery, running time, (local) maximization of the objective, and the number of clusters detected.

The present study is focused on a nonparametric approach based on bootstrap - in order to get out of this constraint. The Mathematical section recalls some definitions and presents the derivation of the new nonparametric bootstrap approach for setting two-sided mean coverage and guaranteed coverage tolerance limits for a balanced one-way random effects model. The section concludes with a simulation study assessing the performance of the bootstrap methods in comparison to classical methods. Finally, the applicability of the proposed intervals is demonstrated by application to the problem of quantitative analytical method validation based on the accuracy profile. This approach is illustrated by an example consisting in the HPLC determination of the vitamers of vitamin 133 (nicotinamide and nicotinic acid) in milk. The efficiency of the new tolerance intervals is demonstrated as well as the applicability of accuracy profiles in the delicate situation where a correction factor must be applied because there is not a full recovery of the analyte.

It critically examines key operational parameters such as reduced electric field, pressure, discharge type, gas type and flow rate, substrate temperature, gap, and how these variables affect the properties of the synthesized or modified polymers. This review also discusses the application of cold plasma in polymer surface modification, underscoring how changes in surface properties (e.g., wettability, adhesion, biocompatibility) can be achieved by controlling various surface processes (etching, roughening, crosslinking, functionalization, crystallinity). A detailed examination of Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) reveals its efficacy in producing thin polymeric films from an array of precursors. Yasuda’s models, Rapid Step-Growth Polymerization (RSGP) and Competitive Ablation Polymerization (CAP), are explained as fundamental mechanisms underpinning plasma-assisted deposition and polymerization processes. Then, the wide array of applications of cold plasma technology is explored, from the biomedical field, where it is used in creating smart drug delivery systems and biodegradable polymer implants, to its role in enhancing the performance of membrane-based filtration systems crucial for water purification, gas separation, and energy production.

First, the two APPJ have been benchmarked in regard to their electrical and physico-chemical properties while interacting with material targets: dielectric plate, liquid sample, metal plate and an equivalent electrical circuit of human body. The propagation properties of the ionization wave interacting with these targets are discussed, in particular the profile of the related pulsed atmospheric plasma streams.

Optimal conditions are identified discarding the conditions where slight alterations may be evidenced by histology (e.g. prenecrotic aspect of keratinocytes, alterations in the collagen structure). Hence, for the two APPJ plasma parameters these conditions are as follow: duty cycle = 14%, repetition frequency = 30 kHz, magnitude = 7 kV, gap = 10 mm and exposure time = 1 min. In a third step, the two plasma jets are utilized on cholangiocarcinoma xenograft tumor model developed in immunodeficient mice.

This study was performed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and dynamic water contact angle (WCA) measurements. After the plasma treatment, a slight increase in the roughness was emphasized, more particularly for the samples treated in a post-discharge supplied in oxygen. Measurements of the surface roughness and of the oxygen surface concentration suggested the competition of two processes playing a role on the surface hydrophilicity and occurring during the post-discharge treatment: the etching and the activation of the surface. The etching rate was estimated to about 2.7 nm.s-1 and 5.8 nm.s-1 for Ar and Ar-O2 post-discharges, respectively. The mechanisms underlying this etching were investigated through experiments, in which we discuss the influence of the O2 flow rate and the distance (gap) separating the plasma torch from the LDPE surface located downstream. O atoms and NO molecules (emitting in the UV range) detected by OES seem to be good candidates to explain the etching process. An ageing study is also presented to evidence the stability of the treated surfaces over 60 days. After 60 days of storage, we showed that whatever the O2 flow rate, the treated films registered a loss of their hydrophilic state since their WCA increased towards a common threshold of 80°. This 'hydrophobic recovery' effect was mostly attributed to the reorientation of induced polar chemical groups into the bulk of the material. Indeed, the relative concentrations of the carbonyl and carboxyl groups at the surface decreased with the storage time and seemed to reach a plateau after 30 days.""]",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01303180,"['0.chim', '0.chim', '1.chim.poly', '0.phys', '1.phys.phys', '2.phys.phys.phys-plasm-ph', '0.spi', '1.spi.plasma']","['LDPE' 'argon' 'post-discharge' 'surface roughness' 'oxygen' 'etching'

As a case study, the spatial patterns of the 9,929 most common surnames of the Netherlands were analyzed by a clustering method called self-organizing maps (SOMs). The resulting clusters grouped surnames with a similar geographic distribution and origin. The analysis was shown to be in agreement with already known features of Dutch surnames, such as 1) the geographic distribution of some well-known locative suffixes, 2) historical census data, 3) the distribution of foreign surnames, and 4) polyphyletic surnames. Thus, these results validate the SOM clustering of surnames, and allow for the generalization of the technique. This method can be applied as a new strategy for a better Y-chromosome sampling design in retrospective population genetics studies, since the idenfication of surnames with a defined geographic origin enables the selection of the living descendants of those families settled, centuries ago, in a given area. In other words, it becomes possible to virtually sample the population as it was when surnames started to be in use. We show that, in a given location, the descendants of those individuals who inhabited the area at the time of origin of surnames can be as low as approximately 20%. This finding suggests 1) the major role played by recent migrations that are likely to have distorted or even defaced ancient genetic patterns, and 2) that standard-designed samplings can hardly portray a reliable picture of the ancient Y-chromosome variability of European populations.']",https://hal.science/hal-00263458,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.gen', '2.sdv.gen.gpo']","['surname' 'patrilineal' 'genetic' 'population' 'clustering'

They are often recognized by elevated incidence of certain hereditary disorders as observed in regions of Charlevoix and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (SLSJ) in Northeastern Quebec. Dominantly transmitted myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is highly prevalent in SLSJ where its carrier rate reaches 1/550, compared with 1/5,000 to 1/50,000 elsewhere. To shed light on the origin of DM1 in this region, we have screened 50 nuclear DM1 families from SLSJ and studied the genetic variation in a 2.05 Mb (2.9 cM) segment spanning the site of the expansion mutation. The markers analyzed included 22 biallelic SNPs and two microsatellites. Among 50 independent DM1 chromosomes, we distinguished ten DM1-associated haplotypes and grouped them into three haplotype families, A, B and C, based on the relevant extent of allele sharing between them. To test whether the data were consistent with a single entry of the mutation into SLSJ, we evaluated the age of the founder effect from the proportion of recombinant haplotypes. Taking the prevalent haplotype A1_21 (58%) as ancestral to all the disease-associated haplotypes in this study, the estimated age of the founder effect was 19 generations, long predating the colonization of Nouvelle-France. In contrast, considering A1_21 as ancestral to the haplotype family A only, yielded the estimated founder age of nine generations, consistent with the settlement of Charlevoix at the turn of 17th century and subsequent colonization of SLSJ. We conclude that it was the carrier of haplotype A (present day carrier rate of 1/730) that was a ""driver"" of the founder effect, while minor haplotypes B and C, with corresponding carrier rates of 1/3,000 and 1/10,000, respectively, contribute DM1 to the incidence level known in other populations.

The 'thrifty genotype' hypothesis proposed that the causal genetic variants were advantageous and selected for during the majority of human evolution. It remains, however, unclear whether genetic data support this scenario. In this study, we characterized patterns of selection at 10 variants associated with type 2 diabetes, contrasting one herder and one farmer population from Central Asia. We aimed at identifying which alleles (risk or protective) are under selection, dating the timing of selective events, and investigating the effect of lifestyle on selective patterns. We did not find any evidence of selection on risk variants, as predicted by the thrifty genotype hypothesis. Instead, we identified clear signatures of selection on protective variants, in both populations, dating from the beginning of the Neolithic, which suggests that this major transition was accompanied by a selective advantage for non-thrifty variants. Combining our results with worldwide data further suggests that East Asia was particularly prone to such recent selection of protective haplotypes.

Methods: We performed a study on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosome polymorphism of patrilineal and cognatic populations from Central Asia. We reconstructed the gene genealogies in each population for both kind of markers and inferred the imbalance level of these genealogies, a parameter directly related to the level of transmission of reproductive success. Results: This imbalance level appeared much stronger for the Y chromosome in patrilineal populations than in cognatic populations, while no difference was found for mtDNA. Furthermore, we showed that this imbalance level correlates negatively with Y-chromosomal, mtDNA, and autosomal genetic diversity. Conclusions: This shows that patrilineality might be one of the factors explaining the male transmission of reproductive success, which, in turn, lead to a reduction of genetic diversity. Thus, notwithstanding the fact that our population genetic approach clearly shows that there is a strong male-biased transmission of reproductive success in patrilineal societies, it also highlights the fact that a social process such as cultural transmission of reproductive success could play an important role in shaping human genetic diversity, although we cannot formally exclude that this transmission has also a genetic component.']",https://hal.science/hal-02122584,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.gen']","['Social organization' 'genetic diversity' 'patrilineal populations'

In matrilineal populations, the descent group affiliation is transmitted by women whereas the socio-political power frequently remains in the hands of men. This situation, named the 'matrilineal puzzle', is expected to promote local endogamy as a coping mechanism allowing men to maintain their decision-making power over their natal descent group. In this paper, we revisit this 'matrilineal puzzle' from a population genetics' point of view. Indeed, such tendency for local endogamy in matrilineal populations is expected to increase their genetic inbreeding and generate isolation-by-distance patterns between villages. To test this hypothesis, we collected ethno-demographic data for 3261 couples and high-density genetic data for 675 individuals from 11 Southeast Asian populations with a wide range of social organizations: matrilineal and matrilocal populations (M), patrilineal and patrilocal populations (P) or cognatic populations with predominant matrilocal residence (C). We observed that M and C populations have higher levels of village endogamy than P populations, and that such higher village endogamy leads to higher genetic inbreeding. M populations also exhibit isolation-by-distance patterns between villages. We interpret such genetic patterns as the signature of the 'matrilineal puzzle'. Notably, our results suggest that any form of matrilocal marriage (whatever the descent rule is) increases village endogamy. These findings suggest that male dominance, when combined with matrilocality, constrains inter-village migrations, and constitutes an underexplored cultural process shaping genetic patterns in human populations.

Here, we study the evolution of genomic diversity through time under CTRS. We show that CTRS has a double impact on population genetics: (1) effective population size decreases when CTRS starts, mimicking a population contraction, and increases back to its original value when CTRS stops; (2) coalescent trees topologies are distorted under CTRS, with higher imbalance and higher number of polytomies. Under long-lasting CTRS, effective population size stabilises but the distortion of tree topology remains, which yields U-shaped Site Frequency Spectra (SFS) under constant population size. We show that this CTRS’ impact yields a bias in SFS-based demographic inference. Considering that CTRS was detected in numerous human and animal populations worldwide, one should be cautious that inferring population past histories from genomic data can be biased by this cultural process.']",https://hal.science/hal-03875721,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.gen', '2.sdv.gen.gpo', '0.info', '1.info.info-bi', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.bid', '2.sdv.bid.evo']","['CTS' 'Reproductive Success' 'Genomic Diversity'

Next, a cross-dataset validation of the models is performed, that is, leave-one-subject-out models trained on a Multi-modal Dataset for Real-time, Continuous Stress Detection from Physiological Signals dataset and validated using the University of Waterloo stress dataset. While both logistic regression and random forest models achieve good classification results in the independent dataset analysis, the random forest model demonstrates better generalization capabilities with a stable F1 score of 61%.

As we are interested in geographic origins, polyphyletic surnames are excluded from further analyses. By comparing the present location of each monophyletic surname to its inferred geographic origin in late Middle Ages/Renaissance, we measure the extent of the migrations having occurred in Italy since that time. We find that the percentage of individuals presently living in the very area where their surname started to be in use centuries ago is extremely variable (ranging from 22.77% to 77.86% according to the province), thus meaning that self-assessed regional identities seldom correspond to the “autochthony” they imply.

Mobile objects are detected using a multi-layer lidar that is simultaneously used to identify a zone of interest to reduce the complexity of the perception process. Object localization and tracking is then performed in a fixed frame which simplifies analysis and understanding of the scene. Finally, tracked objects are confirmed by vision using 3D dense reconstruction in focused regions of interest. Only confirmed objects can generate an alarm or an action on the vehicle. This is crucial to reduce false alarms that affect the trust that the driver places in the driving assistance system.

However, gene expression data is characterized as a high dimensional data that typically encompassed of redundant, noisy, and irrelevant genes. Datasets with such characteristics pose a challenge to machine learning algorithms. This is because they impede the training and testing process and entail high resource computations that deteriorate the classification performance. In order to avoid these pitfalls, gene selection is needed. This paper proposes a new hybrid filter-wrapper approach using robust Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevancy (rMRMR) as a filter approach to choose the topranked genes. Modified Gray Wolf Optimizer (MGWO) is used as a wrapper approach to seek further small sets of genes. In MGWO, new optimization operators inspired by the TRIZ-inventive solution are coupled with the original GWO to increase the diversity of the population. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, nine well-known microarray datasets are tested. The support vector machine (SVM) is employed for the classification task to estimate the goodness of the selected subset of genes. The effectiveness of TRIZ optimization operators in MGWO is evaluated by investigating the convergence behavior of GWO with and without TRIZ optimization operators. Moreover, the results of MGWO are compared with seven state-of-art gene selection methods using the same datasets based on classification accuracy and the number of selected genes.

In this paper, a recent swarm intelligence metaheuristic method called RSO which is inspired by the social and hunting behavior of a group of rats is enhanced and explored for FS problems.

This optimization technique modifies the base algorithm (DMO) in three simple but effective ways. First, the alpha selection in IDMO differs from the DMO, where evaluating the probability value of each fitness is just a computational overhead and contributes nothing to the quality of the alpha or other group members. The fittest dwarf mongoose is selected as the alpha, and a new operator ω is introduced, which controls the alpha movement, thereby enhancing the exploration ability and exploitability of the IDMO. Second, the scout group movements are modified by randomization to introduce diversity in the search process and explore unvisited areas. Finally, the babysitter's exchange criterium is modified such that once the criterium is met, the babysitters that are exchanged interact with the dwarf mongoose exchanging them to gain information about food sources and sleeping mounds, which could result in better-fitted mongooses instead of initializing them afresh as done in DMO, then the counter is reset to zero. The proposed IDMO was used to solve the classical and CEC 2020 benchmark functions and 12 continuous/discrete engineering optimization problems. The performance of the IDMO, using different performance metrics and statistical analysis, is compared with the DMO and eight other existing algorithms.

Second, the Lévy flight operator is integrated with roulette wheel selection method and both are combined with ECSA to augment the exploration behavior and lessen its bias towards exploitation. Finally, an add-on position updating strategy is proposed to develop a further balance between exploration and exploitation conducts. The optimization performance of ECSA is shown by testing it on five various real ELD cases with a generator having 3, 13, 40, 80 and 140 units, each with different constraints. The results of the ELD systems’ analysis depict that ECSA is better than the parent CSA and other state-of-the art methods. Further, the efficacy of ECSA was experimented on several benchmark test functions, and its performance was compared to other well-known optimization methods. Experimental results show that ECSA surpasses other methods on complex benchmark functions with modest computational burdens. The superiority and practicality of ECSA is demonstrated by getting new best solutions for large-scale ELD cases such as 40-unit and 140-unit test systems.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-03957090,"['0.info', '0.info', '1.info.info-ai']","['Chameleon Swarm Algorithm' 'Economic Load Dispatch'

To study idempotent merging, different strategies can be followed. One strategy is to rely on idempotent rules used in either more general or more specific frameworks and to study, respectively, their particularisation or extension to belief functions. In this paper, we study the feasibility of extending the idempotent fusion rule of possibility theory (the minimum) to belief functions. We first investigate how comparisons of information content, in the form of inclusion and least-commitment, can be exploited to relate idempotent merging in possibility theory to evidence theory. We reach the conclusion that unless we accept the idea that the result of the fusion process can be a family of belief functions, such an extension is not always possible. As handling such families seems impractical, we then turn our attention to a more quantitative criterion and consider those combinations that maximise the expected cardinality of the joint belief functions, among the least committed ones, taking advantage of the fact that the expected cardinality of a belief function only depends on its contour function.']",https://hal.science/hal-00651875,"['0.info', '1.info.info-ai']","['Belief functions' 'Dempster rule' 'idempotence' 'possibility theory'

In particular, we propose a generic expression of stochastic orderings, and then use it to systematically investigate extensions of the most usual stochastic orderings to fuzzy intervals.

The unavailability of a specific drug and ready-to-use vaccine makes the situation worse. Hence, policymakers must rely on early warning systems to control intervention-related decisions. Forecasts routinely provide critical information for dangerous epidemic events. However, the available forecasting models (e.g., weather-driven mechanistic, statistical time series, and machine learning models) lack a clear understanding of different components to improve prediction accuracy and often provide unstable and unreliable forecasts. This study proposes an ensemble wavelet neural network with exogenous factor(s) (XEWNet) model that can produce reliable estimates for dengue outbreak prediction for three geographical regions, namely San Juan, Iquitos, and Ahmedabad. The proposed XEWNet model is flexible and can easily incorporate exogenous climate variable(s) confirmed by statistical causality tests in its scalable framework. The proposed model is an integrated approach that uses wavelet transformation into an ensemble neural network framework that helps in generating more reliable long-term forecasts. The proposed XEWNet allows complex non-linear relationships between the dengue incidence cases and rainfall; however, mathematically interpretable, fast in execution, and easily comprehensible. The proposal’s competitiveness is measured using computational experiments based on various statistical metrics and several statistical comparison tests.

The lack of specific drugs and ready-to-use vaccines to prevent most of these epidemics worsens the situation. These force public health officials and policymakers to rely on early warning systems generated by accurate and reliable epidemic forecasters. Accurate forecasts of epidemics can assist stakeholders in tailoring countermeasures, such as vaccination campaigns, staff scheduling, and resource allocation, to the situation at hand, which could translate to reductions in the impact of a disease. Unfortunately, most of these past epidemics exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics due to their spreading fluctuations based on seasonal-dependent variability and the nature of these epidemics. We analyze various epidemic time series datasets using a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) based autoregressive neural network and call it Ensemble Wavelet Neural Network (EWNet) model. MODWT techniques effectively characterize non-stationary behavior and seasonal dependencies in the epidemic time series and improve the nonlinear forecasting scheme of the autoregressive neural network in the proposed ensemble wavelet network framework. From a nonlinear time series viewpoint, we explore the asymptotic stationarity of the proposed EWNet model to show the asymptotic behavior of the associated Markov Chain. We also theoretically investigate the effect of learning stability and the choice of hidden neurons in the proposal. From a practical perspective, we compare our proposed EWNet framework with twenty-two statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models for fifteen real-world epidemic datasets with three test horizons using four key performance indicators.

This choice conflicts with the motivation for fine-tuning, as starting from a pre-trained solution aims at taking advantage of the previously acquired knowledge. Hence, regularizers promoting an explicit inductive bias towards the pre-trained model have been recently proposed.

We also identified disease-specific alterations in diversity, indicating that a Crohn's disease-specific gut environment may favour fungi at the expense of bacteria. The concomitant analysis of bacterial and fungal microbiota showed a dense and homogenous correlation network in HS but a dramatically unbalanced network in IBD, suggesting the existence of disease-specific inter-kingdom alterations.

As dysbiosis has been reported in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), we aim to investigate the impact of IBD-associated dysbiosis on BA metabolism and its influence on the epithelial cell inflammation response. DESIGN: Faecal and serum BA rates, expressed as a proportion of total BA, were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in colonic IBD patients (42) and healthy subjects (29). The faecal microbiota composition was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Using BA profiles and microbiota composition, cluster formation between groups was generated by ranking models. The faecal BA profiles in germ-free and conventional mice were compared. Direct enzymatic activities of BA biotransformation were measured in faeces. The impact of BA on the inflammatory response was investigated in vitro using Caco-2 cells stimulated by IL-1β. RESULTS: IBD-associated dysbiosis was characterised by a decrease in the ratio between Faecalibacterium prausntizii and Escherichia coli. Faecal-conjugated BA rates were significantly higher in active IBD, whereas, secondary BA rates were significantly lower. Interestingly, active IBD patients exhibited higher levels of faecal 3-OH-sulphated BA. The deconjugation, transformation and desulphation activities of the microbiota were impaired in IBD patients. In vitro, secondary BA exerted anti-inflammatory effects, but sulphation of secondary BAs abolished their anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired microbiota enzymatic activity observed in IBD-associated dysbiosis leads to modifications in the luminal BA pool composition. Altered BA transformation in the gut lumen can erase the anti-inflammatory effects of some BA species on gut epithelial cells and could participate in the chronic inflammation loop of IBD.']",https://hal.science/hal-00734237,"['0.chim', '1.chim.orga']","['Inflammatory bowel diseases' 'gut microbiota' 'bile acids' 'dysbiosis'

Method: Patients enrolled while in flare received oral corticosteroid. Once in clinical remission, patients were randomized to receive either FMT or sham transplantation during a colonoscopy. Corticosteroids were tapered and a second colonoscopy was performed at week 6. The primary endpoint was the implantation of the donor microbiota at week 6 (Sorensen index > 0.6). Results: Eight patients received FMT and nine sham transplantation. None of the patients reached the primary endpoint. The steroid-free clinical remission rate at 10 and 24 weeks was 44.4% (4/9) and 33.3% (3/9) in the sham transplantation group and 87.5% (7/8) and 50.0% (4/8; one patient loss of follow-up while in remission at week 12 and considered in flare at week 24) in the FMT group.

Recent simulations, based on smooth particle hydrodynamics and rather strong feedback recipes, have shown that it was indeed possible to form extended dark matter cores using baryonic processes related to a more realistic treatment of the interstellar medium. Using adaptive mesh refinement, together with a new, stronger supernova feedback scheme that we have recently implemented in the RAMSES code, we show that it is also possible to form a prominent dark matter core within the well-controlled framework of an isolated, initially cuspy, 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> dark matter halo. Although our numerical experiment is idealized, it allows a clean and unambiguous identification of the dark matter core formation process. Our dark matter inner profile is well fitted by a pseudo-isothermal profile with a core radius of 800 pc. The core formation mechanism is consistent with the one proposed by Pontzen & Governato. We highlight two key observational predictions of all simulations that find cusp-core transformations: (i) a bursty star formation history with a peak-to-trough ratio of 5 to 10 and a duty cycle comparable to the local dynamical time and (ii) a stellar distribution that is hot with v/σ ∼ 1. We compare the observational properties of our model galaxy with recent measurements of the isolated dwarf Wolf-Lundmark-Mellote (WLM).

However, in recent autoshaping experiments in rats, variation in the form of Pavlovian conditioned responses (CRs) and associated dopamine activity, have questioned the classical hypothesis that phasic dopamine activity corresponds to a reward prediction error-like signal arising from a classical Model-Free system, necessary for Pavlovian conditioning. Over the course of Pavlovian conditioning using food as the unconditioned stimulus (US), some rats (sign-trackers) come to approach and engage the conditioned stimulus (CS) itself - a lever - more and more avidly, whereas other rats (goal-trackers) learn to approach the location of food delivery upon CS presentation. Importantly, although both sign-trackers and goal-trackers learn the CS-US association equally well, only in sign-trackers does phasic dopamine activity show classical reward prediction error-like bursts. Furthermore, neither the acquisition nor the expression of a goal-tracking CR is dopamine-dependent. Here we present a computational model that can account for such individual variations. We show that a combination of a Model-Based system and a revised Model-Free system can account for the development of distinct CRs in rats. Moreover, we show that revising a classical Model-Free system to individually process stimuli by using factored representations can explain why classical dopaminergic patterns may be observed for some rats and not for others depending on the CR they develop. In addition, the model can account for other behavioural and pharmacological results obtained using the same, or similar, autoshaping procedures. Finally, the model makes it possible to draw a set of experimental predictions that may be verified in a modified experimental protocol.

However, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. In recent models, part of the regulation of behavioral control is based on meta-learning principles, e.g. driving exploratory actions by varying a meta-parameter, the inverse temperature, which regulates the contrast between competing action probabilities. Here we investigate how complementary processes between lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) implement decision regulation during exploratory and exploitative behaviors. Model-based analyses of unit activity recorded in these two areas in monkeys first revealed that adaptation of the decision function is reflected in a covariation between LPFC neural activity and the control level estimated from the animal's behavior. Second, dACC more prominently encoded a reflection of outcome uncertainty useful for control regulation based on task monitoring.

Today, new technologies lead to an equilibrium situation where powerful and complex computers bring new biological knowledge of the brain behavior. At this point, we possess sufﬁcient understanding to both imagine new brain-inspired computing paradigms and to sustain a classical paradigm which reaches its end program- ming and intellectual limitations. In this context we propose to reconsider the computation problem ﬁrst in the speciﬁc domain of mobile robotics. Our main proposal consists in considering computation as part of a global adaptive system, com- posed of sensors, actuators, a source of energy and a controlling unit. During the adaptation process, the proposed brain-inspired computing structure does not only execute the tasks of the application but also re- acts to the external stimulation and acts on the emergent behavior of the system. This approach is inspired by cortical plasticity in mammalian brains and suggests developing the computation architecture along the system’s experience. This paper proposes modeling this plasticity as a problem of estimating a probability density function. This function would correspond to the nature and the richness of the environment perceived through multiple modalities. We deﬁne and develop a novel neural model solving the problem in a distributed and sparse manner. And we integrate this neural map into a bio-inspired hardware substrate that brings the plasticity property into parallel many-core architectures. The approach is then called Hardware Plasticity. The results show that the self-organization properties of our model solve the problem of multimodal sensory data clusterization. The properties of the proposed model allow envisaging the deployment of this adaptation layer into hardware architectures embedded into the robot’s body in order to build intelligent controllers.']",https://hal.science/hal-01103430,"['0.info', '1.info.info-ne', '0.info', '1.info.info-ar', '0.spi', '1.spi.nano']","['brain-inspired computing' 'computational science' 'mobile robotics'

Contrary to classical approaches to decision theory, we try to rank acts without resorting to any numerical representation of utility or uncertainty, and without using any scale on which both uncertainty and preference could be mapped. Our approach is a variant of Savage's where the setting is finite, and the strict preference on acts is a partial order. It is shown that although many axioms of Savage theory are preserved and despite the intuitive appeal of the ordinal method for constructing a preference over acts, the approach is inconsistent with a probabilistic representation of uncertainty. The latter leads to the kind of paradoxes encountered in the theory of voting. It is shown that the assumption of ordinal invariance enforces a qualitative decision procedure that presupposes a comparative possibility representation of uncertainty, originally due to Lewis, and usual in nonmonotonic reasoning. Our axiomatic investigation thus provides decision-theoretic foundations to the preferential inference of Lehmann and colleagues. However, the obtained decision rules are sometimes either not very decisive or may lead to overconfident decisions, although their basic principles look sound. This paper points out some limitations of purely ordinal approaches to Savage-like decision making under uncertainty, in perfect analogy with similar difficulties in voting theory.""]",https://hal.science/hal-01185798,['0.info'],"['Decision making' 'uncertainty' 'artificial intelligence'

Here, we develop ELGRIN, a statistical model that simultaneously combines knowledge on interspecific interactions (i.e., the metanetwork), environmental data and species occurrences to tease apart their relative effects on species distributions. Instead of focusing on single effects of pairwise species interactions, which have little sense in complex communities, ELGRIN contrasts the overall effect of species interactions to that of the environment. Using various simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate the suitability of ELGRIN to address the objectives for various types of interspecific interactions like mutualism, competition and trophic interactions. We then apply the model on vertebrate trophic networks in the European Alps to map the effect of biotic interactions on species distributions.

When produced at experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, these long-lived particles (LLPs) can decay far from the interaction vertex of the primary proton–proton collision. Such LLP signatures are distinct from those of promptly decaying particles that are targeted by the majority of searches for new physics at the LHC, often requiring customized techniques to identify, for example, significantly displaced decay vertices, tracks with atypical properties, and short track segments. Given their non-standard nature, a comprehensive overview of LLP signatures at the LHC is beneficial to ensure that possible avenues of the discovery of new physics are not overlooked. Here we report on the joint work of a community of theorists and experimentalists with the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments—as well as those working on dedicated experiments such as MoEDAL, milliQan, MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, and FASER—to survey the current state of LLP searches at the LHC, and to chart a path for the development of LLP searches into the future, both in the upcoming Run 3 and at the high-luminosity LHC. The work is organized around the current and future potential capabilities of LHC experiments to generally discover new LLPs, and takes a signature-based approach to surveying classes of models that give rise to LLPs rather than emphasizing any particular theory motivation. We develop a set of simplified models; assess the coverage of current searches; document known, often unexpected backgrounds; explore the capabilities of proposed detector upgrades; provide recommendations for the presentation of search results; and look towards the newest frontiers, namely high-multiplicity ‘dark showers’, highlighting opportunities for expanding the LHC reach for these signals.']",https://hal.science/hal-02080682,"['0.phys', '1.phys.hexp', '0.phys', '1.phys.hphe']","['Particles' 'Standard Model' 'Long-lived particles'

However, this rule assumes the classifiers to be independent. This paper investigates the use of other operators for combining non independent classifiers, including the cautious rule and, more generally, t-norm based rules with behavior ranging between Dempster's rule and the cautious rule. Two strategies are investigated for learning an optimal combination scheme, based on a parameterized family of t- norms. The first one learns a single rule by minimizing an error criterion. The second strategy is a two-step procedure, in which groups of classifiers with similar outputs are first identified using a clustering algorithm. Then, within- and between-cluster rules are determined by minimizing an error criterion. Experiments with various synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of both the single rule and two-step strategies. Overall, optimizing a single t-norm based rule yields better results than using a fixed rule, including Dempster's rule, and the two-step strategy brings further improvements.""]",https://hal.science/hal-00651369,"['0.info', '1.info.info-cv']","['Classifier fusion' 'Dempster-Shafer framework' 't-norm'

A seminal model developed by Rice (Rice WR. 1984. Sex chromosomes and the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Evolution 38:735-742.) predicts that the X chromosome should be a hotspot for the accumulation of loci under SA selection as compared with the autosomes. Here, we propose a methodological framework designed to detect a specific signature of SA selection on viability, differences in allelic frequencies between the sexes. Applying this method on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in human populations where no sex-specific population stratification could be detected, we show that there are overall significantly more SNPs exhibiting differences in allelic frequencies between the sexes on the X chromosome as compared with autosomes, supporting the predictions of Rice's model. This pattern is consistent across populations and is robust to correction for potential biases such as differences in linkage disequilibrium, sample size, and genotyping errors between chromosomes. Although SA selection is not the only factor resulting in allelic frequency differences between the sexes, we further show that at least part of the identified X-linked loci is caused by such a sex-specific processes.""]",https://hal.science/hal-02122292,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.gen', '2.sdv.gen.gpo', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.gen', '2.sdv.gen.gh']","['Sexually antagonistic selection' 'Sex chromosomes' 'Evolution' 'SNPs'

A well known result of Erdös and Gallai (1960) shows that the same problem related to graphs can be solved in polynomial time. So, it becomes relevant to detect classes of uniform hypergraphs that are reconstructible in polynomial time. In particular, our study concerns 3-uniform hypergraphs that are defined in the NP-completeness proof of Deza et al. Those hypergraphs are constructed starting from a non-increasing sequence s of integers and have very interesting properties. In particular, they are unique, i.e., there do not exist two non isomorphic 3-uniform hypergraphs having the same degree sequence ds. This property makes us conjecture that the reconstruction of these hypergraphs from their degree sequences can be done in polynomial time. So, we first generalize the computation of the ds degree sequences by Deza et al., and we show their uniqueness. We proceed by defining the equivalence classes of the integer sequences determining the same ds and we define a (minimal) representative. Then, we find the asymptotic growth rate of the maximal element of the representatives in terms of the length of the sequence, with the aim of generating and then reconstructing them. Finally, we show an example of a unique 3-uniform hypergraph similar to those defined by Deza et al. that does not admit a generating integer sequence s. The existence of this hypergraph makes us conjecture an extended generating algorithm for the sequences of Deza et al. to include a much wider class of unique 3-uniform hypergraphs. Further studies could also include strategies for the identification and reconstruction of those new sequences and hypergraphs.']",https://hal.science/hal-03232982,"['0.info', '1.info.info-dm']","['3-uniform hypergraph' 'NP-completeness' 'degree sequence'
