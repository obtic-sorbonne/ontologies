Eoulsan is a versatile open-source workflow engine meeting the needs of core facilities, by automating the analysis of a large number of samples. Its core design separates the description of the workflow from the actual commands to be run. This originality simplifies its usage as the user does not need to handle code, while ensuring reproducibility. Eoulsan was initially developed for bulk RNA-seq data, but the transcriptomics applications have recently widened with the advent of long-read sequencing and single-cell technologies, calling for the development of new workflows. Result We present Eoulsan 2, a major update that (i) enhances the workflow manager itself, (ii) facilitates the development of new modules, and (iii) expands its applications to long reads RNA-seq (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and scRNA-seq (Smart-seq2 and 10x Genomics). The workflow manager has been rewritten, with support for execution on a larger choice of computational infrastructure (workstations, Hadoop clusters, and various job schedulers for cluster usage). Eoulsan now facilitates the development of new modules, by reusing wrappers developed for the Galaxy platform, with support for container images (Docker or Singularity) packaging tools to execute. Finally, Eoulsan natively integrates novel modules for bulk RNA-seq, as well as others specifically designed for processing long read RNA-seq and scRNA-seq. Eoulsan 2 is distributed with ready-to-use workflows and companion tutorials. Availability and implementation Eoulsan is implemented in Java, supported on Linux systems and distributed under the LGPL and CeCILL-C licenses at: http://outils.genomique.biologie.ens.fr/eoulsan/ . The source code and sample workflows are available on GitHub: https://github.com/GenomicParisCentre/eoulsan .

Experimental data indicated that this decrease was a strong determinant of renal fibrogenesis, hence a focus for therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, whether persistently differentiated renal tubules, surviving in a pro-fibrotic environment, also suffer from a decrease in FAO, is currently unknown. Methods: To address this question, we isolated proximal tubules captured ex vivo on the basis of the expression of an intact brush border antigen (Prominin-1) in C57BL6/J mice subjected to a controlled, two-hit model of renal fibrosis (reversible ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) or sham surgery, followed by angiotensin 2 administration). A transcriptomic high throughput sequencing was performed on total mRNA from these cells, and on whole kidneys. Results: In contrast to mice subjected to sham surgery, mice with a history of AKI displayed histologically more renal fibrosis when exposed to angiotensin 2. High throughput RNA sequencing, principal component analysis and clustering showed marked consistency within experimental groups. As expected, FAO transcripts were decreased in whole fibrotic kidneys. Surprisingly, however, up- rather than down-regulation of metabolic pathways (oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, and PPAR signalling pathway) was a hallmark of the differentiated tubules captured from fibrotic kidneys. Immunofluorescence co-staining analysis confirmed that the expression of FAO enzymes was dependent of tubular trophicity. Conclusions: These data suggest that in differentiated proximal tubules energetic hyperactivity is promoted concurrently with organ fibrogenesis.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-02565135,"['0.sdv', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.mhep']","['Fatty Acid Oxidation' 'kidney disease' 'chronic kidney disease'

The highly productive strains in use today were generated by classical mutagenesis. To learn how cellulase production was improved by these techniques, we performed massively parallel sequencing to identify mutations in the genomes of two hyperproducing strains (NG14, and its direct improved descendant, RUT C30). We detected a surprisingly high number of mutagenic events: 223 single nucleotides variants, 15 small deletions or insertions, and 18 larger deletions, leading to the loss of more than 100 kb of genomic DNA. From these events, we report previously undocumented non-synonymous mutations in 43 genes that are mainly involved in nuclear transport, mRNA stability, transcription, secretion/vacuolar targeting, and metabolism. This homogeneity of functional categories suggests that multiple changes are necessary to improve cellulase production and not simply a few clear-cut mutagenic events. Phenotype microarrays show that some of these mutations result in strong changes in the carbon assimilation pattern of the two mutants with respect to the wild-type strain QM6a. Our analysis provides genome-wide insights into the changes induced by classical mutagenesis in a filamentous fungus and suggests areas for the generation of enhanced T. reesei strains for industrial applications such as biofuel production.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-02879345,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.bibs']","['Trichoderma' 'reesei' 'cellulases' 'hemicellulases' 'biomass' 'biofuels'
