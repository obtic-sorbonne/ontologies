The induction mechanisms of T. reesei cellulases have been described recently, but the regulation of the genes involved in their transcription has not been studied thoroughly. Here we report the regulation of expression of the two activator genes xyr1 and ace2, and the corepressor gene ace1, during the induction of cellulase biosynthesis by the inducer lactose in T. reesei QM 9414, a strain producing low levels of cellulase (low producer). We show that all three genes are induced by lactose. xyr1 was also induced by d-galactose, but this induction was independent of d-galactose metabolism. Moreover, ace1 was carbon catabolite repressed, whereas full induction of xyr1 and ace2 in fact required CRE1. Significant differences in these regulatory patterns were observed in the high-producer strain RUT C30 and the hyperproducer strain T. reesei CL847. These observations suggest that a strongly elevated basal transcription level of xyr1 and reduced upregulation of ace1 by lactose may have been important for generating the hyperproducer strain and that thus, these genes are major control elements of cellulase production.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-02879336,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.bibs']"

Eoulsan is a versatile open-source workflow engine meeting the needs of core facilities, by automating the analysis of a large number of samples. Its core design separates the description of the workflow from the actual commands to be run. This originality simplifies its usage as the user does not need to handle code, while ensuring reproducibility. Eoulsan was initially developed for bulk RNA-seq data, but the transcriptomics applications have recently widened with the advent of long-read sequencing and single-cell technologies, calling for the development of new workflows. Result We present Eoulsan 2, a major update that (i) enhances the workflow manager itself, (ii) facilitates the development of new modules, and (iii) expands its applications to long reads RNA-seq (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and scRNA-seq (Smart-seq2 and 10x Genomics). The workflow manager has been rewritten, with support for execution on a larger choice of computational infrastructure (workstations, Hadoop clusters, and various job schedulers for cluster usage). Eoulsan now facilitates the development of new modules, by reusing wrappers developed for the Galaxy platform, with support for container images (Docker or Singularity) packaging tools to execute. Finally, Eoulsan natively integrates novel modules for bulk RNA-seq, as well as others specifically designed for processing long read RNA-seq and scRNA-seq. Eoulsan 2 is distributed with ready-to-use workflows and companion tutorials. Availability and implementation Eoulsan is implemented in Java, supported on Linux systems and distributed under the LGPL and CeCILL-C licenses at: http://outils.genomique.biologie.ens.fr/eoulsan/ .

In the present study we have compared BC cells with two closely related cell types, NC and Schwann cell precursors (SCpr), by RNA profiling. This led to the definition of a set of 10 genes that show specific expression in BC cells and/or in their derivatives along the nerve roots. Analysis of the expression of these genes during mouse development revealed novel features, of those most important are: (i) dorsal and ventral nerve root BC cell derivatives express different sets of genes, suggesting that they have distinct properties; (ii) these cells undergo major modifications in their gene expression pattern between embryonic days 14.5 and 17.5, possibly linked to the SCpr-immature Schwann cell transition; (iii) nerve roots SC differ from more distal SC not only in their origins and locations, but also in their gene expression patterns.

The highly productive strains in use today were generated by classical mutagenesis. As byproducts of this procedure, mutants were generated that turned out to be unable to produce cellulases. In order to identify the mutations responsible for this inability, we sequenced the genome of one of these strains, QM9136, and compared it to that of its progenitor T. reesei QM6a. Results : In QM9136, we detected a surprisingly low number of mutagenic events in the promoter and coding regions of genes, i.e. only eight indels and six single nucleotide variants. One of these indels led to a frame-shift in the Zn2Cys6 transcription factor XYR1, the general regulator of cellulase and xylanase expression, and resulted in its C-terminal truncation by 140 amino acids. Retransformation of strain QM9136 with the wild-type xyr1 allele fully recovered the ability to produce cellulases, and is thus the reason for the cellulase-negative phenotype. Introduction of an engineered xyr1 allele containing the truncating point mutation into the moderate producer T. reesei QM9414 rendered this strain also cellulase-negative. The correspondingly truncated XYR1 protein was still able to enter the nucleus, but failed to be expressed over the basal constitutive level. Conclusion : The missing 140 C-terminal amino acids of XYR1 are therefore responsible for its previously observed auto-regulation which is essential for cellulases to be expressed. Our data present a working example of the use of genome sequencing leading to a functional explanation of the QM9136 cellulase-negative phenotype.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01149671,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp']"

Experimental data indicated that this decrease was a strong determinant of renal fibrogenesis, hence a focus for therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, whether persistently differentiated renal tubules, surviving in a pro-fibrotic environment, also suffer from a decrease in FAO, is currently unknown. Methods: To address this question, we isolated proximal tubules captured ex vivo on the basis of the expression of an intact brush border antigen (Prominin-1) in C57BL6/J mice subjected to a controlled, two-hit model of renal fibrosis (reversible ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) or sham surgery, followed by angiotensin 2 administration). A transcriptomic high throughput sequencing was performed on total mRNA from these cells, and on whole kidneys. Results: In contrast to mice subjected to sham surgery, mice with a history of AKI displayed histologically more renal fibrosis when exposed to angiotensin 2. High throughput RNA sequencing, principal component analysis and clustering showed marked consistency within experimental groups. As expected, FAO transcripts were decreased in whole fibrotic kidneys. Surprisingly, however, up- rather than down-regulation of metabolic pathways (oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, and PPAR signalling pathway) was a hallmark of the differentiated tubules captured from fibrotic kidneys. Immunofluorescence co-staining analysis confirmed that the expression of FAO enzymes was dependent of tubular trophicity.

A(1)R and D(1)R, but not A(1)R and D(2)R, were found to coimmunoprecipitate in cotransfected fibroblasts. This selective A(1)R/D(1)R heteromerization disappeared after pretreatment with the D(1)R agonist, but not after combined pretreatment with D(1)R and A(1)R agonists. A high degree of A(1)R and D(1)R colocalization, demonstrated in double immunofluorescence experiments with confocal laser microscopy, was found in both cotransfected fibroblast cells and cortical neurons in culture. On the other hand, a low degree of A(1)R and D(2)R colocalization was observed in cotransfected fibroblasts. Pretreatment with the A(1)R agonist caused coclustering (coaggregation) of A(1)R and D(1)R, which was blocked by combined pretreatment with the D(1)R and A(1)R agonists in both fibroblast cells and in cortical neurons in culture. Combined pretreatment with D(1)R and A(1)R agonists, but not with either one alone, substantially reduced the D(1)R agonist-induced accumulation of cAMP. The A(1)R/D(1)R heteromerization may be one molecular basis for the demonstrated antagonistic modulation of A(1)R of D(1)R receptor signaling in the brain. The persistence of A(1)R/D(1)R heteromerization seems to be essential for the blockade of A(1)R agonist-induced A(1)R/D(1)R coclustering and for the desensitization of the D(1)R agonist-induced cAMP accumulation seen on combined pretreatment with D(1)R and A(1)R agonists, which indicates a potential role of A(1)R/D(1)R heteromers also in desensitization mechanisms and receptor trafficking.']",https://hal.science/hal-00122183,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.neu']"

To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in this interaction and to identify novel genes required for myelination, we performed an RNA profiling analysis, comparing Schwann cells cultured alone or in the presence of neurons. This led to the selection of 30 genes, mostly upregulated on Schwann cell-axon interaction. Most of the identified proteins are associated with the extracellular space or signal transduction systems, consistent with possible roles in Schwann cell-axon interaction. We performed a functional analysis of one of these genes, Dok4 (downstream of kinase-4), which encodes a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase substrate. Silencing RNA-mediated knock-down of Dok4 severely affected in vitro myelination. Moreover, Dok4 is required at early stages in the myelination process, including the initial interaction with the axon, and is also involved in Schwann cell migration and proliferation. Finally, this analysis establishes the interest of our gene collection in further understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in Schwann cell-axon interaction.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-02879339,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.bibs']"

Several strains have been developed in the past using random mutagenesis, and despite impressive performance enhancements, the pressure for low-cost cellulases has stimulated continuous research in the field. In this context, comparative study of the lower and higher producer strains obtained through random mutagenesis using systems biology tools (genome and transcriptome sequencing) can shed light on the mechanisms of cellulase production and help identify genes linked to performance. Previously, our group published comparative genome sequencing of the lower and higher producer strains NG 14 and RUT C30. In this follow-up work, we examine how these mutations affect phenotype as regards the transcriptome and cultivation behaviour. Results: We performed kinetic transcriptome analysis of the NG 14 and RUT C30 strains of early enzyme production induced by lactose using bioreactor cultivations close to an industrial cultivation regime. RUT C30 exhibited both earlier onset of protein production (3 h) and higher steady-state productivity. A rather small number of genes compared to previous studies were regulated (568), most of them being specific to the NG 14 strain (319). Clustering analysis highlighted similar behaviour for some functional categories and allowed us to distinguish between induction-related genes and productivity-related genes. Cross-comparison of our transcriptome data with previously identified mutations revealed that most genes from our dataset have not been mutated. Interestingly, the few mutated genes belong to the same clusters, suggesting that these clusters contain genes playing a role in strain performance. Conclusions: This is the first kinetic analysis of a transcriptomic study carried out under conditions approaching industrial ones with two related strains of T. reesei showing distinctive cultivation behaviour. Our study sheds some light on some of the events occurring in these strains following induction by lactose. The fact that few regulated genes have been affected by mutagenesis suggests that the induction mechanism is essentially intact compared to that for the wild-type isolate QM6a and might be engineered for further improvement of T. reesei. Genes from two specific clusters might be potential targets for such genetic engineering.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01112360,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.bc']"

Here we review the oligonucleotide design field to help users make their choice. We have first performed a comparative evaluation of the available solutions based on a set of criteria including: ease of installation, user-friendly access, the number of parameters and settings available. In a second step, we chose to submit two real cases to a selection of programs. Finally, we used a set of tests for the in silico benchmark of the oligo sets obtained from each type of software. We show that the design software must be selected according to the goal of the scientist, depending on factors such as the organism used, the number of probes required and their localization on the target sequence.
