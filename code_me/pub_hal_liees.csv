The induction mechanisms of T. reesei cellulases have been described recently, but the regulation of the genes involved in their transcription has not been studied thoroughly. Here we report the regulation of expression of the two activator genes xyr1 and ace2, and the corepressor gene ace1, during the induction of cellulase biosynthesis by the inducer lactose in T. reesei QM 9414, a strain producing low levels of cellulase (low producer). We show that all three genes are induced by lactose. xyr1 was also induced by d-galactose, but this induction was independent of d-galactose metabolism. Moreover, ace1 was carbon catabolite repressed, whereas full induction of xyr1 and ace2 in fact required CRE1. Significant differences in these regulatory patterns were observed in the high-producer strain RUT C30 and the hyperproducer strain T. reesei CL847. These observations suggest that a strongly elevated basal transcription level of xyr1 and reduced upregulation of ace1 by lactose may have been important for generating the hyperproducer strain and that thus, these genes are major control elements of cellulase production.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-02879336,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.bibs']"

Eoulsan is a versatile open-source workflow engine meeting the needs of core facilities, by automating the analysis of a large number of samples. Its core design separates the description of the workflow from the actual commands to be run. This originality simplifies its usage as the user does not need to handle code, while ensuring reproducibility. Eoulsan was initially developed for bulk RNA-seq data, but the transcriptomics applications have recently widened with the advent of long-read sequencing and single-cell technologies, calling for the development of new workflows. Result We present Eoulsan 2, a major update that (i) enhances the workflow manager itself, (ii) facilitates the development of new modules, and (iii) expands its applications to long reads RNA-seq (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and scRNA-seq (Smart-seq2 and 10x Genomics). The workflow manager has been rewritten, with support for execution on a larger choice of computational infrastructure (workstations, Hadoop clusters, and various job schedulers for cluster usage). Eoulsan now facilitates the development of new modules, by reusing wrappers developed for the Galaxy platform, with support for container images (Docker or Singularity) packaging tools to execute. Finally, Eoulsan natively integrates novel modules for bulk RNA-seq, as well as others specifically designed for processing long read RNA-seq and scRNA-seq. Eoulsan 2 is distributed with ready-to-use workflows and companion tutorials. Availability and implementation Eoulsan is implemented in Java, supported on Linux systems and distributed under the LGPL and CeCILL-C licenses at: http://outils.genomique.biologie.ens.fr/eoulsan/ .

This led to the definition of a set of 10 genes that show specific expression in BC cells and/or in their derivatives along the nerve roots. Analysis of the expression of these genes during mouse development revealed novel features, of those most important are: (i) dorsal and ventral nerve root BC cell derivatives express different sets of genes, suggesting that they have distinct properties; (ii) these cells undergo major modifications in their gene expression pattern between embryonic days 14.5 and 17.5, possibly linked to the SCpr-immature Schwann cell transition; (iii) nerve roots SC differ from more distal SC not only in their origins and locations, but also in their gene expression patterns.

The highly productive strains in use today were generated by classical mutagenesis. As byproducts of this procedure, mutants were generated that turned out to be unable to produce cellulases. In order to identify the mutations responsible for this inability, we sequenced the genome of one of these strains, QM9136, and compared it to that of its progenitor T. reesei QM6a. Results : In QM9136, we detected a surprisingly low number of mutagenic events in the promoter and coding regions of genes, i.e. only eight indels and six single nucleotide variants. One of these indels led to a frame-shift in the Zn2Cys6 transcription factor XYR1, the general regulator of cellulase and xylanase expression, and resulted in its C-terminal truncation by 140 amino acids. Retransformation of strain QM9136 with the wild-type xyr1 allele fully recovered the ability to produce cellulases, and is thus the reason for the cellulase-negative phenotype. Introduction of an engineered xyr1 allele containing the truncating point mutation into the moderate producer T. reesei QM9414 rendered this strain also cellulase-negative. The correspondingly truncated XYR1 protein was still able to enter the nucleus, but failed to be expressed over the basal constitutive level. Conclusion : The missing 140 C-terminal amino acids of XYR1 are therefore responsible for its previously observed auto-regulation which is essential for cellulases to be expressed. Our data present a working example of the use of genome sequencing leading to a functional explanation of the QM9136 cellulase-negative phenotype.']",https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-01149671,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bbm', '2.sdv.bbm.gtp']"

Experimental data indicated that this decrease was a strong determinant of renal fibrogenesis, hence a focus for therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, whether persistently differentiated renal tubules, surviving in a pro-fibrotic environment, also suffer from a decrease in FAO, is currently unknown. Methods: To address this question, we isolated proximal tubules captured ex vivo on the basis of the expression of an intact brush border antigen (Prominin-1) in C57BL6/J mice subjected to a controlled, two-hit model of renal fibrosis (reversible ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) or sham surgery, followed by angiotensin 2 administration). A transcriptomic high throughput sequencing was performed on total mRNA from these cells, and on whole kidneys. Results: In contrast to mice subjected to sham surgery, mice with a history of AKI displayed histologically more renal fibrosis when exposed to angiotensin 2. High throughput RNA sequencing, principal component analysis and clustering showed marked consistency within experimental groups. As expected, FAO transcripts were decreased in whole fibrotic kidneys. Surprisingly, however, up- rather than down-regulation of metabolic pathways (oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis, and PPAR signalling pathway) was a hallmark of the differentiated tubules captured from fibrotic kidneys. Immunofluorescence co-staining analysis confirmed that the expression of FAO enzymes was dependent of tubular trophicity.

The persistence of A(1)R/D(1)R heteromerization seems to be essential for the blockade of A(1)R agonist-induced A(1)R/D(1)R coclustering and for the desensitization of the D(1)R agonist-induced cAMP accumulation seen on combined pretreatment with D(1)R and A(1)R agonists, which indicates a potential role of A(1)R/D(1)R heteromers also in desensitization mechanisms and receptor trafficking.']",https://hal.science/hal-00122183,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.neu']"

This led to the selection of 30 genes, mostly upregulated on Schwann cell-axon interaction. Most of the identified proteins are associated with the extracellular space or signal transduction systems, consistent with possible roles in Schwann cell-axon interaction. We performed a functional analysis of one of these genes, Dok4 (downstream of kinase-4), which encodes a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase substrate. Silencing RNA-mediated knock-down of Dok4 severely affected in vitro myelination. Moreover, Dok4 is required at early stages in the myelination process, including the initial interaction with the axon, and is also involved in Schwann cell migration and proliferation.

We found that the time-course production of an artificial chimera protein containing the DNA-binding domain of Yrr1p activated the 15 genes that are also up-regulated by a gain-of-function mutant of Yrr1p. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the promoters of the genes AZR1, FLR1, SNG1, YLL056C, YLR346C, and YPL088W interacted with Yrr1p. The putative consensus Yrr1p binding site deduced from these experiments, (T/A)CCG(C/T)(G/T)(G/T)(A/T)(A/T), is strikingly similar to the PDR element binding site sequence recognized by Pdr1p and Pdr3p. The minor differences between these sequences are consistent with Yrr1p and Pdr1p and Pdr3p having different sets of target genes. According to these data, some target genes are directly regulated by Pdr1p and Pdr3p or by Yrr1p, whereas some genes are indirectly regulated by the activation of Yrr1p.

Here, we show that tonic activation of adenosine receptors is able to impede desensitization of D1 dopamine receptors. As measured by cAMP accumulation in transfected COS-7 cells, long-term exposure to dopamine agonists promoted desensitization of D1B receptor but not that of D1A receptor. The inability of D1A receptor to desensitize was a result of the adenosine present in culture medium acting through activation of adenosine A1 receptors. Cell incubation with either adenosine deaminase, CGS-15943, a generic adenosine receptor antagonist, or the A1 antagonist DPCPX restored the long-term desensitization time-course of D1A receptors. In Ltk cells stably expressing A1 adenosine receptors and D1A dopamine receptors, pre-treatment of cells with R(-)-PIA, a full A1 receptor agonist, did not significantly inhibit the acute increase in cAMP levels induced by D1 receptor agonists, but blocked desensitization of D1A receptors. However, simultaneous activation of A1 and D1A receptors promoted a delayed D1A receptor desensitization. This suggests that functional interaction between A1 and D1A receptors may depend on the activation kinetics of components regulating D1 receptor responses, acting differentially on D1A and D1B receptors.']",https://hal.science/hal-00122159,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.neu']"

Anatomical data suggested that this segment regulates the intracellular traffic and localization of the receptor. To directly address this question we used a combination of tagging procedures and immunocytochemical techniques to detect each of the two D(2) receptor isoforms. Surprisingly, most of the newly synthesized receptors accumulate in large intracellular compartments, the plasma membrane being only weakly labeled, without significant difference between the two receptor isoforms. Double labeling experiments showed that this localization corresponded neither to endosomal compartments nor to the Golgi apparatus. The D(2) receptor is mostly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the long isoform more efficiently than the short one. It is accompanied by a striking vacuolization of the ER, roughly proportional to the expression levels of the two receptor isoforms. This phenomenon is partly overcome by treatment with pertussis toxin. In addition, an intrinsic activity of the D(2) receptor isoforms is revealed by [(35)S]-GTP gamma S binding and cAMP assay, which suggested that expression of weakly but constitutively active D(2) receptors promotes activation of heterotrimeric G protein inside the secretory pathway.

Quatre sous-types du récepteur D1 (D1A, D1B/D5, D1C et D1D) ont été clonés jusqu'à présent chez les vertébrés. L'analyse évolutive montre que les sous-types D1A et D1B sont les plus conservés alors que les sous-types D1C et D1D sont absents chez les mammifères. Malgré cette diversité, les fonctions de la dopamine dans l'organisme ne peuvent pas être rapportées à l'action d'un sous-type précis. C'est pourquoi au cours de ce travail nous avons identifié des caractères fonctionnels capables de distinguer chacun des sous-types et de comprendre pour quelle raison ils ont été conservés chez les vertébrés. La désensibilisation est un des paramètres fonctionnels les plus important. Le récepteur D1A se caractérise par une baisse d'activité forte et biphasique, le récepteur D1B par un profil proche avec une amplitude plus faible conséquence de son activité constitutive. Enfin, le récepteur D1C ne semble pas être capable de se désensibiliser. La construction de chimères entre chacun des sous-types du récepteur D1 et la protéine GFP ont permis la visualisation des récepteurs au cours de la désensibilisation. Elles montrent que l'internalisation ne semble pas, pour les récepteurs D1 de la dopamine, intervenir dans le processus de désensibilisation fonctionnelle. L'activation simultanée des récepteurs A1 de l'adénosine bloque l'activité des récepteurs D1. L'analyse des voies de signalisation MAPK a montré que l'activation de la voie ERK était rapide et forte, et différente selon les sous-types. La voie p38 n'est que faiblement activée et la voie JNK semble ne pas l'être du tout. Il semble donc que les mécanismes d'activation et de régulation des voies de signalisation différencient les sous-types du récepteur D1 chez les vertébrés. Ces paramètres participent de façon majeure à la transmission régulée des fonctions de la dopamine dans l'organisme."", 'Dopamine effect is transmitted by its fixation on receptors that belong to two classes D1 and D2. Four D1 receptor subtypes (D1A, D1B/D5, D1C and D1D) were cloned until today in vertebrates. Evolutive analysis shows that D1A and D1B subtypes are the most conserved while D1C and D1D subtypes are missing in mammals. Despite this diversity, dopamine function in the whole organism cannot be assigned to one specific subtype action. For this reason, all along this work we have identified functional characters which may discriminate each of the subtypes and which help to understand why they were conserved in vertebrates. Desensitisation is one of the most important functional parameter of receptor cell biology. The D1A receptor desensitisation is characterised by a strong and biphasic decrease in activity. The D1B receptor exhibit a similar profile with a weaker amplitude due to its constitutive activity. The D1C receptor does not undergo any desensitisation. Construction of chimerical proteins between each of the D1 receptor subtypes and the GFP fluorescent protein allowed us to visualised the receptor during the desensitisation process. It shows that internalisation, of the D1 dopamine receptor does not occur in conjonction with the general process of desensitisation. These phenomenon are blurred by interaction with the A1 adenosine receptor. To conclude, the analysis of MAPK signalisation pathways show that ERK activation was fast and strong and differentiate each subtypes of the subtypes. Moreover, if the p38 pathway was only weakly activated, the JNK one does not show any activity. Thus, it appears so that differential activation and regulation of signalisation pathway discriminate D1 dopamine receptor subtypes in vertebrates. These parameters participate to the regulated transmission of dopamine functions in the whole organism.']",https://theses.hal.science/tel-00009188,"['0.sdv', '1.sdv.bc', '0.sdv', '1.sdv.neu']"
